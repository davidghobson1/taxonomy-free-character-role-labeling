This led many detractors of the self-styled ""anarcho-capitalist"" to call his candidacy a ""leap into the void"". Now, with the mop-haired president-elect only two weeks away from taking over Latin America's third-largest economy, many are asking, how will his policies and positions face the test of reality? Javier Milei had proposed to dollarise the economy and eliminate the Argentine Central Bank as a strategy to ""kill"" hyper-inflation. This meant making the US dollar the national currency in place of the Argentine peso, whose value, Mr Milei said, had been ""melting like blocks of ice in the Sahara"".  One obstacle is that ditching the Central Bank and making the US dollar legal tender would need approval from Argentina's Congress and could even require changing the constitution. Although Mr Milei convincingly won the presidency, his Libertad Avanza (Freedom Advances) movement is barely the third largest political force in Congress. This suggests difficult negotiations might be in store. Some economists have also questioned whether Mr Milei's plans are feasible, saying they would weaken his government's ability to manage domestic monetary policy. Having the US dollar as the Argentine currency would effectively leave interest rate policy in the hands of the US Federal Reserve. Argentina's economy would be more vulnerable to external shocks involving the US dollar, for example sudden rises in prices for oil and fuel imports, which could make internal adjustments even more painful inside the country.  Sceptics also point out that Argentina would need to have in hand the US dollars to replace the pesos. Experts believe this could require anywhere between US $35bn to $50bn which indebted Argentina currently does not have and may not be able to borrow easily. Mr Milei himself has admitted his ""shock adjustment"" economic stabilisation recipe could actually take up to two years to bring down inflation. ""Saying anything else is lying,"" he said. Another topic that had made media headlines was Mr Milei's apparent declaration of himself as a climate change ""sceptic"", that is, someone who denies the role of humans in global warming. ""I do not deny climate change. What I am saying is that there is a temperature cycle in the history of the Earth... Therefore, all those policies that blame humans for climate change are false,"" Mr Milei said during a presidential debate last month, causing much commentary and criticism. In his proposed government programme, one of the numerous ministries he had said he planned to axe would be the existing environment ministry.  Such apparent climate scepticism risked putting Mr Milei sharply out of tune with an international majority of governments and leaders who plan to gather at the COP28 climate conference in Dubai soon to seek urgent solutions to the problems of climate change and global warming. Before he was elected, Mr Milei virulently attacked Argentine Pope Francis, calling him a ""Jesuit who promotes communism"", and even the ""representative of the evil one [the Devil] on Earth"".  Such statements caused frictions with the local Catholic Church and the Vatican.  However, this antagonism appeared to miraculously dissipate only days after his election win, when Mr Milei had what he called a ""very friendly"" phone call with the Pope, whom he addressed as ""Your Holiness"", inviting him to visit Argentina in 2024. Asked in a TV interview about this change of heart, Mr Milei conceded that, when one is president, ""there are some things that require greater doses of pragmatism"". Before his election, Milei had signalled he could freeze ties with Brazil and China, Argentina's two top trading partners, on the grounds that he did ""not make pacts with communists"".  ""I am going to be aligned with the United States, Israel, and the free world,"" he said.  Not surprisingly, this assertion caused consternation in Beijing and Brasilia, as well as in Argentina. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson was quoted as warning that it would be a ""huge foreign policy mistake"" for Argentina to cut ties with countries such as China and Brazil.  Mr Milei's predecessor, outgoing left-wing President Alberto Fernández, had carefully nurtured ties with Beijing and had welcomed an invitation to join Brics, the China-led group which also comprises Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa. Experts questioned the wisdom of dismantling a relationship that clearly brought benefits to Argentina, and not only by China being a top market for Argentina's soybean, meat and grains. China was also helping to prop up Argentina's financial reserves with a major currency swap deal - significant support for a country already heavily indebted to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Days after the election, however, there seemed to be clear signs that no major break in relations was planned. The president-elect received a personal letter of ""congratulations and good wishes"" from Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mr Milei himself made a point of thanking Xi on social media. Mr Milei's pick for foreign minister, Diana Mondino, also dismissed as ""nonsense"" any suggestion that there would be a rupture in ""commercial relations"" with China or Brazil. In Brazil, Mr Milei's invitation for former President Jair Bolsonaro to attend his 10 December inauguration was interpreted as ""unfriendly"" towards Brazil's current left-wing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.  But Milei has since said Lula would be ""well-received"", if he wanted to come. Mr Milei and his vice-presidential running-mate Victoria Villarruel also ignited intense controversy during the campaign with their position regarding Argentina's 1976-83 military dictatorship. Defying traditional positions held by Argentina's government and society for the last 40 years, Mr Milei caused outrage by contesting the generally accepted estimate of those abducted and ""disappeared"" in the dictatorship - 30,000 - asserting the actual number was closer to 9,000. The candidate argued that the political violence of the 1970s in Argentina was a two-sided ""war"" in which ""the forces of the state committed excesses but the terrorists [anti-government guerrillas] ... [also] committed crimes against humanity"". This equivalence of presentation of the two sides raised howls of protest from groups like the Plaza de Mayo mothers and grandmothers of disappeared persons. This was just another striking way in which the Milei-Villarruel duo were trying to shake up the political status quo in Argentina. The next four years will show if they can do it.","Javier Milei, the anti-establishment politician who cruised to victory in the Argentine presidential election last week, has courted intense controversy with radical, provocative policy proposals and statements.

State-run Myanma Alinn newspaper said Wednesday that three Chinese vessels were anchored in Yangon,Myanmar’s largest city, and that officials from both nations met Tuesday to discuss the maritime security exercises. The Chinese vessels – the destroyer Zibo, frigate Jing Zhou and supply ship Qian Dao Hu – carry about 700 sailors and arrived at the Myanmar port Monday. The report didn’t give more details on the drills. Myanmar’s military seized power from an elected government in 2021 and since has been in armed conflict with pro-democracy forces and ethnic militias. The visit of the Chinese vessels comes during an upsurge in violence on Myanmar's border with China by the Three Brotherhood Alliance, a group of militias that launched a coordinated offensive against the ruling military on Oct. 27. China is Myanmar’s biggest trading partner and maintains good relations with the ruling generals. The groups in the alliance also have good relations with China and have vowed to protect foreign investments such as Chinese-backed projects in territory they control. The alliance has claimed widespread victories including four border crossings in the northern part of Shan state, and the military government acknowledged soon after fighting began that it had lost three towns. The alliance’s offensive has energized the nationwide armed struggle to overthrow the military regime that was installed after the army seized power, and fighting has spread to many parts of the country. On Wednesday, the resistance forces in the northwestern Chin state seized a small town in Matupi township bordering India, according to Salai Danny, a spokesperson of the Chinland Defense Force-Zotung militia group. Beijing has called for a cease-fire and has said the warring parties should try and resolve their differences through dialogue. It has not, however, used its influence with the militia groups to pressure them to put an end to the fighting. Before the offensive, China had been growingly discontented with the military government's inattention to large-scale criminality in Myanmar near the border, including drug trafficking and cyberscam centers. As the Three Brotherhood Alliance has gained ground, thousands of Chinese nationals involved in such operations have been repatriated into police custody in China. Supporters of Myanmar's ruling generals have held several demonstrations in major cities accusing China of aiding the militia alliance. Maj. Gen.

About 90,000 people have been displaced in Myanmar due to the intensifying conflict between the country’s military rulers and an alliance of ethnic armed groups, the United Nations said. “As of 9 November, almost 50,000 people in northern Shan were forced into displacement,” the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update on Friday. A further 40,000 people have been displaced by clashes between the military and its opponents in neighbouring Sagaing region and Kachin state since early November, OCHA added. Two weeks ago, the Three Brotherhood Alliance, one of Myanmar’s most powerful ethnic armed alliances, launched a coordinated attack on a dozen military outposts in northern Shan state, which sits on the country’s eastern border with China, and captured the border town of Chin Shwe Haw. Theoffensiveis the most serious test for the generals since they seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. A statement from the Three Brotherhood Alliance stated that seeks to defend territory against Myanmar military incursions, eradicate “oppressive military dictatorship,” and combat online fraud along the border. On Thursday, Myint Swe, appointed as Myanmar’s president after the coup,tolda national defence and security council meeting in the country that “if the government does not effectively manage the incidents happening in the border region, the country will be split into various parts”. According toOCHA, almost all of the people who have been displaced since the conflict began on October 26 are seeking refuge in religious compounds. A few have entered existing internally displaced persons (IDP) sites. The UN body warned that disrupted transport, communications, and other services were hindering humanitarian responses to the fighting. “Ongoing hostilities, coupled with the existence of checkpoints, road closures, and structural damage to bridges, are severely restricting the ability of humanitarian agencies to reach affected people, conduct verification of needs, and transport vital supplies,” OCHA said. The violence has also raised concern in Beijing, which is putting pressure on the Myanmar military to crack down on crime in the border area. China maintains billions of dollars worth of energy infrastructure investments in the remote area of Myanmar. Beijing has, since the coup, continued to engage diplomatically with the military while also serving as one of itsbiggest arms suppliers. Jason Tower, Myanmar country director with the United States Institute of Peace (USIP),told Al Jazeerathat China has shown a “growing willingness … to flex its muscles in influencing all of the actors involved in the revolution or the conflict in Myanmar” since the coup. “It’s important to look closely at how China is going to use that influence,” he said.

Included in the group of animals now declared extinct are the Little Mariana fruit bat, also known as a flying fox, in Guam; two species of fish, including the San Marcos gambusia in Texas and Scioto madtom in Ohio, and eight species of mussels. Ten species of birds, including the Bachman's warbler, a small yellow and black songbird, in Florida and South Carolina; the Bridled white-eye, a green, yellow and white tropical lowland forest bird from Guam, and eight honeycreeper species in Hawaii, have also been delisted.  The decision to delist the species was made after rigorous reviews for each of the species, most of which were listed under the ESA in the 1970s and 1980s, when populations were already dwindling severely, according to theUSFWS. The action signals a ""wake-up call"" on the importance of conservation, especially for threatened species, before the decline becomes irreversible, according to the USFWS.

Several more bird species in Hawaii are also on the brink of extinction, Greenwald said, adding that climate change is exacerbating risks to threatened species. ""Few people realize the extent to which the crises of extinction and climate change are deeply intertwined,"" Greenwald said. ""Both threaten to undo our very way of life, leaving our children with a considerably poorer planet.

On Monday, a peace activist from Be’er Sheva, in southern Israel, learned that his friend, Khalil Abu Yahia, a resident of the war-torn Gaza Strip, had been killed in an Israeli air strike. “He was one of the organisers of the Great March of Return,” said Yossef Mekyton, visibly shaken and emotional when referring to the March 2018 to December 2019 pro-Palestinian protests held along the Israel-Gaza border. “And he was killed with his whole family.” Mekyton, an Israeli citizen, has long supported the rights of the Palestinians. But since the events of October 7 – when Hamas fighters breached the Gaza border with Israel, killing some 1,400 Israelis, prompting an unprecedented scale of bombardment on the Palestinian enclave – Mekyton says that many Israeli-based activists live in a climate of “fear”. “I think one of the most effective ways to commit suicide these days in Israel is to go out on the street with a Palestinian flag,” the graphic designer told Al Jazeera. While the treatment of activists felt threatening before October 7, it is “much more threatening” now, he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised to destroy Hamas – which has controlled the impoverished Gaza Strip since 2007 – following the group’s incursion and kidnapping spree. But Israel’s relentless shelling of Gaza has killed 8,500 Palestinian civilians, including more than 3,500 children. Israeli troops claim that among the dead are several Hamas commanders. The Palestinian group has not yet announced any deaths of its fighters. On Wednesday, as fighting raged, the Israeli military struck the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, a day after it first bombed the site, killing dozens of Palestinians. Fear and panic have gripped most sections of Israeli society following the Hamas attacks, making the activities of Israel’s activist population more conspicuous than ever. “I am facing harassment by individuals on social media,” said Israeli Ofer Neiman, a pro-Palestinian resident of Jerusalem and supporter of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, which is committed to putting political and economic pressure on Israel to end its occupation of the Palestinian West Bank and blockade of the Gaza Strip. “Will it get worse? Yes, perhaps – it is concerning.” On October 28, dozens of Israelis attended an anti-war protest in Tel Aviv – widely regarded as a liberal city. “In terms of going out to demonstrate, I would feel reasonably safe in the Tel Aviv demonstration. But in other places, such as in Jerusalem where I live, I would not feel safe,” said Neiman. Last month, Israeli Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtaiwarnedthere would be “zero tolerance” for domestic rallies supporting Gaza. But there are signs of a crackdown that go beyond protests. Israeli Jewish sociolinguist Uri Horesh recently announced that he had been suspended from his lecturing role at Israel’s Achva Academic College, citing his opposition to the attacks on Gaza as the reason for his dismissal. Israel Frey, an ultra-Orthodox Israeli journalist, was forced into hiding after expressing support for the people of Gaza – which he said made him the target of far-right activists. And it was reported that an Israeli citizen had been arrested on account of a publicly displayed sign. “There is no sanctity in an occupied city,” read the sign, which had reportedly been hung from the window of his Jerusalem home for years. Jerusalem: 10 police officers break in to the house of an Israeli activist, arresting him for this years old sign he has hanging out the window, reading “there is no sanctity in an occupied city” (sounds better in Hebrew).Another step in the repression of critical voiceshttps://t.co/whcxmgOHBN — Haggai Matar (@Ha_Matar)October 25, 2023  “The [dominant] voices that we are hearing [in Israel] are either right-wing voices for genocide or mainstream voices for war, maybe not always with the genocidal language, but still in favour of bombing Gaza,” said Neiman of the prevailing mood in Israel. But did the shock of the Hamas attack on southern Israel cause the country’s peaceniks to question their commitment to the Palestinian cause? No, says Neta Golan, an Israeli pro-Palestinian activist and an active member of Israelis Against Apartheid. “But that doesn’t mean that we don’t feel for those [Israelis] who were affected or for the families of the hostages,” said the seasoned campaigner who currently lives in Nablus, in the occupied West Bank. Golan says she has “been arrested more times than I can count” by Israeli authorities for her past activism. Her group sent a letter to Karim Khan, prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, on Wednesday requesting “accelerated action against the escalating Israeli war crimes”. “We really hope that all civilians everywhere return to their homes, whether it’s the Israelis returning to their families or Palestinians returning to their homeland from which they were expelled [when Israel was established] in 1948,” she said. Tali Shapiro, another Israeli activist based in the occupied West Bank – in Ramallah – also says she did not question her long-held pro-Palestinian convictions following the events of October 7. “What it did cause me to do, was to call my parents in the south [of Israel] to make sure they were okay,” Shapiro told Al Jazeera. “And to open up my account [on X] to look for my Gazan friends because obviously [we knew where] this was going.” For Mekyton, the conflict has strengthened his commitment to keep campaigning for Palestinian rights. “But it also [makes me feel] weakened,” he said. “I feel so powerless right now – but I feel like I want to do something. I hope this contradiction will resolve itself somehow.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","Activists in Israel say that as right-wing, pro-war voices dominate the social discourse, their work has never felt more important.

Yes, perhaps – it is concerning.” On October 28, dozens of Israelis attended an anti-war protest in Tel Aviv – widely regarded as a liberal city. “In terms of going out to demonstrate, I would feel reasonably safe in the Tel Aviv demonstration. But in other places, such as in Jerusalem where I live, I would not feel safe,” said Neiman. Last month, Israeli Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtaiwarnedthere would be “zero tolerance” for domestic rallies supporting Gaza. But there are signs of a crackdown that go beyond protests. Israeli Jewish sociolinguist Uri Horesh recently announced that he had been suspended from his lecturing role at Israel’s Achva Academic College, citing his opposition to the attacks on Gaza as the reason for his dismissal. Israel Frey, an ultra-Orthodox Israeli journalist, was forced into hiding after expressing support for the people of Gaza – which he said made him the target of far-right activists. And it was reported that an Israeli citizen had been arrested on account of a publicly displayed sign. “There is no sanctity in an occupied city,” read the sign, which had reportedly been hung from the window of his Jerusalem home for years. Jerusalem: 10 police officers break in to the house of an Israeli activist, arresting him for this years old sign he has hanging out the window, reading “there is no sanctity in an occupied city” (sounds better in Hebrew).Another step in the repression of critical voiceshttps://t.co/whcxmgOHBN — Haggai Matar (@Ha_Matar)October 25, 2023  “The [dominant] voices that we are hearing [in Israel] are either right-wing voices for genocide or mainstream voices for war, maybe not always with the genocidal language, but still in favour of bombing Gaza,” said Neiman of the prevailing mood in Israel. But did the shock of the Hamas attack on southern Israel cause the country’s peaceniks to question their commitment to the Palestinian cause? No, says Neta Golan, an Israeli pro-Palestinian activist and an active member of Israelis Against Apartheid. “But that doesn’t mean that we don’t feel for those [Israelis] who were affected or for the families of the hostages,” said the seasoned campaigner who currently lives in Nablus, in the occupied West Bank. Golan says she has “been arrested more times than I can count” by Israeli authorities for her past activism. Her group sent a letter to Karim Khan, prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, on Wednesday requesting “accelerated action against the escalating Israeli war crimes”. “We really hope that all civilians everywhere return to their homes, whether it’s the Israelis returning to their families or Palestinians returning to their homeland from which they were expelled [when Israel was established] in 1948,” she said. Tali Shapiro, another Israeli activist based in the occupied West Bank – in Ramallah – also says she did not question her long-held pro-Palestinian convictions following the events of October 7. “What it did cause me to do, was to call my parents in the south [of Israel] to make sure they were okay,” Shapiro told News Agency. “And to open up my account [on X] to look for my Gazan friends because obviously [we knew where] this was going.” For Mekyton, the conflict has strengthened his commitment to keep campaigning for Palestinian rights. “But it also [makes me feel] weakened,” he said. “I feel so powerless right now – but I feel like I want to do something. I hope this contradiction will resolve itself somehow.”          Follow News Agency:",955,"[""Yossef Mekyton"", ""Khalil Abu Yahia"", ""Benjamin Netanyahu"", ""Ofer Neiman"", ""Neta Golan"", ""Tali Shapiro""]","[""Yossef Mekyton"", ""Khalil Abu Yahia"", ""Benjamin Netanyahu"", ""Neta Golan""]",1aiFgOJ5l5zr_HYfxxA4PggDN9AXx89JJ

Democrat Gabe Amo and Republican Gerry Leonard are vying for Rhode Island's 1st Congressional District seat. The winner will fill the office left vacant when former Democratic Rep.David Cicilline stepped down this summer to become president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation. Amo, 35, grew up in Pawtucket as the son of Ghanaian and Liberian immigrants. He emerged victorious from a crowded Democratic field in the September primary, claiming more than 32 per cent of the vote.  The former White House aide served in the Obama and Biden administrations, most recently as deputy director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. He also served in the administration of former Democratic governor Gina Raimondo.  Amo, who went to Wheaton College and studied public policy at Oxford University, has said he was inspired by his parents. His mother studied nursing and his father opened a liquor store in part to be his own boss.  Amo said he would fight against what he described as ""extremist"" Republican attempts to slash funding for Social Security and Medicare, work to legalize abortion rights nationwide and support legislation at the federal level to combat climate change. He also said he would push to ban assault-style firearms, support funding for research into gun violence prevention at the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and implement universal background checks.  His win would mark an ongoing transition from the state's Italian-American political hierarchy, embodied by the late Vincent ""Buddy"" Cianci, Providence's charismatic longtime mayor who went to prison for corruption.  Leonard, a Marine veteran and political newcomer, is hoping to reclaim the seat for the GOP in the heavily Democratic state. The last Republican to represent the district was Ron Machtley, who served from 1989-1995.  Leonard has said he believes Americans know how to live their lives better than bureaucrats and professional politicians do.  He has criticized ""Bidenomics,"" saying Democratic President Joe Biden's economic plan hasn't helped ordinary citizens, and said he favours a more limited government. He has also said he would back US efforts to aid Ukraine in its war against Russia but he thinks there should be clear goals and an exit strategy.  Leonard also said he believes states should be responsible for making laws on abortion, in line with the US Supreme Court's ruling last year that overturned constitutional protections for abortion established in Roe v Wade.  Leonard describes himself as a 13th-generation Rhode Islander whose ancestors fled England to escape religious persecution. He attended public schools and graduated from North Kingstown High in 1983.  He moved on to a 30-year career in the Marine Corps that included multiple overseas deployments - including combat tours in Kuwait, Somalia, Iraq, and Afghanistan - as an infantry and reconnaissance officer, Leonard said.

The joint announcement came on the eve of a summit between PresidentsJoe Bidenand Xi Jinping that is aimed at stabilizing the rocky U.S.-China relationship. Cooperation between the world's two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases is considered vital to the success of the U.N. climate talks opening in two weeks in Dubai. It wasn't clear earlier this year whether the two governments would cooperate, given a sharp deterioration in ties over other issues including technology, Taiwan and Russia's war in Ukraine. Both countries “are aware of the important role they play” and “will work together ... to rise up to one of the greatest challenges of our time,” they said in a statement released Wednesday in Beijing and Tuesday evening in Washington. They reiterated a pledge made by the Group of 20 nations, of which both are members, to pursue efforts to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030. Chinese companies are looking to sell wind and solar power equipment abroad, having invested heavily in factories for their manufacture. “If the two countries can work together to shore up the buy-in for the target, that will very considerably smooth the way for having it adopted,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, the lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. The U.S. andChinaagreed to restart talks on energy policies and launch a working group on enhancing climate action in what they called “the critical decade of the 2020s.” Experts say the world needs to act now to have any chance of achieving the agreed-upon goal of limiting the average increase in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit). A climate expert described the agreement by both countries to include methane in their next climate action plans as “a major step."" “Methane has been notably absent from China’s previous commitment” under the 2015 climate treaty known as the Paris Agreement, said David Waskow, the international climate director at the World Resources Institute. He noted that China is the world’s largest emitter of methane and that “serious actions to curb this gas is essential for slowing global warming in the near-term.” The Chinese government issued an action plan last week to control methane emissions, including the development of an accounting and reporting system for emissions. Major emitters include coal mines, oil and gas fields, farms, landfills and sewage treatment plants. Myllyvirta said the plan is very generic without any measurable emissions targets, so “follow-up on that front will be important.” The U.S. and China also said that together with the United Arab Emirates, they would host a meeting on methane and other greenhouse gases during the upcoming U.N. talks in Dubai. Waskow expressed disappointment that the joint statement didn't pledge to phase out fossil fuels. That wasn't a surprise — even as China has rapidly expanded in wind and solar power, it has encouraged the construction of coal power plants, which it sees as a more reliable source of power for periods of peak demand. The government announced last week that it would begin making “capacity payments” next year to coal power plant operators to keep them open and available for use, even as revenues fall as their electricity production is increasingly replaced by renewable energy. The U.S.-China joint statement welcomed climate cooperation between states, provinces and cities and said the two countries would hold a high-level event on such cooperation in the first half of 2024.

Yossi Sneider told the BBC of his horror on recognising his cousin and her two young children surrounded by militants in a video. He tried to contact his family at 06:00 on Saturday to make sure they were safe, but nobody answered. Mr Sneider has not been able to reach his cousin's parents or husband either. A few hours after the attempted call on Saturday morning, he came across a picture of what appeared to be his cousin, Shiri Bib, and her two children - four-year-old Ariel and nine-month-old Kfir. ""At about 10am, 10:30, on Saturday morning I saw a picture of Shiri holding these two little children, with Hamas terrorists all surrounding her."" ""I couldn't believe the picture,"" Mr Sneider told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  On Saturday, Hamas broke through the barrier between Gaza and Israel and its militants launched a murderous assault that has left more than 900 people dead.  The brutal attack has been widely condemned.  Retaliatory Israeli air strikes have killed more than 700 people in the Gaza Strip, local authorities say. Soon after receiving the picture, Mr Sneider said he received a video showing Shiri ""being held by terrorists... crying with the two babies in her hands"". ""They've taken them without any food, without any diapers, without anything,"" Mr Sneider added. ""We only hope that they didn't separate them from their mother.""  Shiri's parents and husband - Margit Silverman, Yossi Silverman and Yarden - are also missing. Mr Sneider tried to make contact but ""we didn't hear from them"", he says. Margit's health is one of his main concerns. ""Margit is a very, very sick person. She has very bad Parkinson's, a lot of blood issues, and is diabetic."" While Mr Sneider is certain his cousin and her two children have been taken as hostages, he says he is not ""100% sure"" about what has happened to Margit, Yossi and Yarden. He described his cousin Shiri, a kindergarten teacher, as gentle and kind. ""She doesn't deserve this experience; nobody does,"" he said. ""I have no words to describe this."" Israel's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, has said ""between 100 and 150"" people are being held hostage in Gaza after being kidnapped from Israel.  On Tuesday, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said the families of 50 hostages had been notified by the military. The armed wing of Hamas, the Qassam brigades, has threatened to execute one captive for each new Israeli airstrike on civilian homes without warning. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has compared Hamas to the Islamic State group and said his country is planning to deploy ""unprecedented force"".  Asked about what he believes should happen next, Mr Sneider said he would support the decisions made by Israel's government and military.  ""We are not dealing with people,"" he claimed.

Gaza City —As bombs rain down upon neighbourhoods and refugee camps in Gaza, hundreds of Palestinian families are setting up temporary homes in an unlikely place:hospital common areas. Tents are popping up in hospital corridors, parking lots and courtyards, as families seek safety in and around medical facilities — places that should be protected under international humanitarian law. It is only the latest sign of the new reality as the Israel-Hamas war reaches its 29th day on Saturday, with growing fears of medical supply shortages and explosions disrupting the vital health services unfolding at hospitals and clinics. With only cloth walls for privacy, families inside the tents are going about their daily routines, sleeping, eating and trying to reestablish a sense of normalcy. These tents began to appear only days after the war broke out on October 7. Not only do they serve as temporary shelter for those escaping death and destruction in residential areas, but some also act as makeshift surgeries and emergency rooms as the Palestinian death toll soars past 9,000. Women and children comprise a mass majority of the hospital inhabitants. Privacy is a distant memory, and the challenges of living in a hospital are manifold. Food, clean water and toilet facilities are severely rationed and available only sporadically: once or twice a day. A seven-member family sheltering in a tent spoke anonymously to Al Jazeera about their hardship. They mentioned that they lack protection from the nearby shelling and the debris it raises, as well as from the biting cold at night. “Overnight, from having everything, we now have nothing,” one of the family members said. Families like theirs also face the heightened possibilities of infection and contact with toxic chemicals, as medical treatment continues in other tents nearby. Health facilities across Gaza have reported shortages of medical supplies. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the scarcity has become a grave problem for both medical personnel and patients, causing the quality of healthcare to deteriorate rapidly. The shortage of anaesthesia has become glaringly apparent at theAl-Shifa Hospital, the biggest health facility in Gaza, established in 1946. Doctors there are reportedly forced to perform surgery on patients without medicine to dull their pain, causing them indescribable agony. Intensive care units or ICUs, meanwhile, have too few beds to accommodate the hundreds of patients with severe injuries. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, spaces for such cases have been exhausted since mid-October. The Indonesian Hospital, serving over 150,000 residents in northern Gaza, is on the brink of ceasing its operations, raising alarm among health officials. The Al-Shifa Hospital is also on the verge of a complete shutdown. The hospital, which provides critical health services to central Gaza, may soon be unable to admit more patients or treat injuries.      With only 546 beds, it is now treating over 1,000 injured people. The hospital has even resorted to conducting surgery in its yards, using the sun to light the medical procedures due to the lack of electricity and fuel. “The hospital is expected to go completely dark within hours,” Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesperson for the Health Ministry, warned on Wednesday. An additional 50,000 to 60,000 people are taking shelter in the hospital’s yards. Al-Qudra said that Gaza’s health sector faces catastrophe unless fuel and medical supplies reach the besieged enclave. He calledon Egyptto facilitate the urgent delivery of medical aid to Gaza. On October 21,20 truckswith health supplies and other necessary goods crossed into Gaza from Egypt for the first time, beginning the flow of humanitarian assistance. But aid has beenslow to arrive, in part due to ongoing Israeli bombing in the border area. The Palestinian Ministry of Health has said as well that the international aid allocated for Gaza’s health sector barely covers its essential operations and falls short of its most dire needs. Attacks on or near medical facilities and workers have also dealt a severe blow to Gaza’s healthcare system since the war began. Palestinian officials have blamed Israeli air strikes for explosions at several healthcare centres, including the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital in the south and the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in central Gaza City, resulting in hundreds of deaths. Israel’s military has also acknowledged striking ambulances, alleging that one of the vehiclesin a medical convoy on Fridaywas “being used by a Hamas terrorist cell”. Al-Qudra said “a big number” of health workers were killed in the blast. An estimated 25 ambulances have been hit, and 136 healthcare workers killed, since the start of the war. The Health Ministry and Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) have called for medical facilities and first responders to be protected from the violence, in accordance withinternational law. Article 18 of the Geneva Convention specifies that civilian hospitals should “in no circumstances be the object of attack”. Medical transport is likewise protected under humanitarian law. Nevertheless, medical institutions in Gaza have continued toface fire. On October 29, PRCS said it received a notification from Israeli forces to evacuate theAl-Quds Hospitalin the Tal al-Hawa area of Gaza City, ahead of a planned bombing there. The hospital housed hundreds of patients and an estimated 12,000 displaced Palestinians. The Government Media Office in Gaza and the Health Ministry have characterised such attacks as “war crimes”, calling for accountability.      The continued violence has also increased concerns for the mental and physical wellbeing of healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, administrative staff and rescue crews. Working around the clock, some are facing extreme exhaustion. Others are suffering psychological fatigue from treating gruesome injuries or the frustration of lacking resources. “Before the war, we would be responsible for alleviating the stress and trauma of the sick and injured, but now it is us who need an outlet for our exhausted bodies and spirits,” said nurse Huda Shokry from the Al-Daraj Medical Complex. Still, Dr Ahmed Ghoul, an emergency room supervisor at Al-Daraj, told Al Jazeera that the professionals he works with are dedicated to caring for their patients. “Despite the shortage of nearly everything necessary to effectively do our jobs, we do not leave our rooms, day or night, except for quick toilet breaks,” he said. “We have lost track of the days of the week because we are more concerned with the thousands of injured individuals than over time.” Doctors like Ghoul have no place to sleep even if they have the chance to. Their personal rooms have been converted into patient treatment areas, and their beds are used for surgery and emergency care. Hospital kitchens, meanwhile, have largely stopped functioning. They lack the basic resources to prepare meals for staff or patients. “We have grown weary of what we have been witnessing,” Shokry told Al Jazeera. “Being a doctor in the war in Gaza means losing one’s sense of fear and exhaustion.” “It is impossible to maintain a normal psyche or even emotions.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","Tent cities are emerging around Gaza healthcare facilities as doctors contend with shortages, exhaustion and air strikes.

Himachal Pradesh aims to generate revenue through water cess on power projects, and a Water Cess Commission has been established for this purpose. The revenue expected from water cess has been reduced to Rs 1842 crore due to discussions with companies.

Gou needs to gather 290,000 signatures by Thursday to qualify as an independent candidate. Prosecutors have questioned 13 people and raided several locations over suspected bribery in Gou's signature campaign.

The court learned that seven out of eleven positions in the CIC were vacant, while several state commissions were also facing vacancies. The court instructed the Union government to collect information on vacancies and pending complaints under the RTI Act. It further directed the government and states to fill the vacancies and take immediate action to ensure the law's implementation.Centre's letter asking to withdraw water cess unjustified: Himachal deputy CM AgnihotriThe Deputy Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh, Mukesh Agnihotri, has objected to the central government's repeated letters regarding the imposition of water cess. He argues that imposing water cess is the jurisdiction of the state government and other states, such as Uttarakhand, have also implemented it to increase revenue. Himachal Pradesh aims to generate revenue through water cess on power projects, and a Water Cess Commission has been established for this purpose. The revenue expected from water cess has been reduced to Rs 1842 crore due to discussions with companies.

The first lady was in the state for her husband’s reelection campaign, but this was no political rally. Instead, she was at a sprawling 75-year-old institution founded for “feebleminded” children that the U.S. Justice Department had deemed “a classic example of warehousing.” She was joined by Gov. Hugh Gallen, a kindred spirit who had been pushing to correct the deplorable conditions there and at the state’s psychiatric hospital. “Going to a place like the Laconia State School and talking not to voters but to people dealing with a very acute issue — well, it doesn’t happen very often. It didn’t then, and it certainly doesn’t at all now,” recalled Dayton Duncan, who was there as Gallen’s press secretary. “She could have just given a good speech about what the administration was hoping to do and left it at that,” Duncan said. “But the fact that she would go to the Laconia State School and meet with the people who work there, the children who were warehoused there and the parents, was special.” After leaving the White House, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter launched programs that have, among other things, monitoredelections in at least 113 countries and nearly eradicated the Guinea worm parasite in the developing world. But the former president has said that The Carter Center would have been a success had it accomplished nothing but his wife’s mental health work. That’s according to Kathy Cade, vice chair of Atlanta-based center and a longtime aide to Rosalynn Carter, and others who know the couple. They spoke to The Associated Press in the months leading up to Rosalynn Carter's death Sunday at age 96. “I do not think there has ever been another sort of leader in the mental health field who has had as much of an impact on mentalhealth careand access to care and how we think about mental health and mental illness as Mrs. Carter,” Cade said. “And I think it has to do with her incredible concern about the issue and her perseverance for more than 50 years.” What evolved into a lifelong crusade began during Carter’s 1966 gubernatorial campaign in Georgia. Almost daily, Rosalynn was approached by voters distressed about loved ones housed at an overcrowded psychiatric hospital. Early one morning, she spoke to a weary cotton mill worker who explained that she and her husband worked opposite shifts to care for their mentally ill daughter. “The image of the woman haunted me all day,” Rosalynn Carter wrote in her 2010 book, “Within Our Reach: Ending the Mental Health Crisis.” That night, she went to her husband’s campaign rally and waited in line to shake his hand. “I came to see what you are going to do to help people with mental illness when you are governor,” she told the surprised candidate. Jimmy Carter responded by creating a state commission to improve services for those with mental illness. Then, as president, he created a national commission on mental health, which led to the passage of the Mental Health Systems Act of 1980, a major revamping of federal policy that sought to treat people with mental illness in their communities. Rosalynn Carter was that commission's honorary co-chair and a driving force behind the legislation, traveling around the country to hear from experts and everyday citizens alike and sharing her findings with Congress. Though it was effectively repealed during the Reagan administration, advocates say it created a framework for much of the progress since then. At The Carter Center, she created a program devoted solely to mental health in 1991 and eventually established fellowships for journalists who cover the topic. Years later, she lobbied Congress to create a landmark law requiring insurers to provide equality in mental health coverage. Those who worked with her over the decades say Carter’s accomplishments were rooted in her compassion and listening skills. “Her power comes from her heart,” said Cynthia Wainscott, a former board chair of Mental Health America, a national nonprofit organization. “She’s very, very, very kind, and she listens to people. When you’re talking to her, there can be three conversations going on around you, but you know she’s keyed on you, and she hears you.” She also was an effective and inspiring mobilizer with sharp instincts, Wainscott said. Preparing for an annual mental health symposium, Carter once suggested contacting a pollster to refine a key message: that 20% of Americans will have a psychiatric disorder in any given year. The pollster conducted focus groups and found that people didn’t believe the statistic, but if it was restated as one in five Americans instead, they did. “When you hear 20%, you have to visualize 100 people and 20 of them are sick, and it’s complex and impersonal. If you say one in five, people think about their workplace, their school, their neighborhood,” said Wainscott, who also led the National Mental Health Association of Georgia. “If she hadn’t been in that room, none of us would have thought of asking a pollster to tell us how to phrase it,” she said. “It was brilliant.” Journalist Bill Lichtenstein considered Rosalynn Carter “the patron saint of all who are dealing with mental health or behavioral issues.” Lichtenstein, who runs a media production company in Boston, was an investigative reporter for ABC News when he fell ill with manic depression in 1986. He went on to produce award-winning programs on recovery from mental illness, but he still remembers feeling shunned when he disclosed his own struggles. Carter’s desire to reduce such stigma is at the heart of her accomplishments, he said. “At the end of the day, whether it’s talking about more money for research or people with a mental health history being on a level playing field when it comes to employment or renting an apartment, the thing that’s the most insidious, difficult obstacle to all of it is stigma,” he said. Lichtenstein serves on the board of advisers for The Carter Center’s mental health journalism fellowship program, which has provided support to more than 220 journalists from the U.S. and six other countries over the years. Marion Scher, a freelance journalist and author in South Africa, was awarded a fellowship in 2005. Her first article, headlined “When is it more than just a bad day?” was published in a men’s health magazine along with the phone number for a mental health organization. The response, in a country where stigma remains strong, was massive, she said. “The phone was ringing off the hook for three weeks,” she said. “They had to bring in extra counselors to man the phones.” Scher now offers mental health journalism fellowships in South Africa, using local sponsorships. That kind of multiplier effect illustrates the impact of The Carter Center fellowships, and it wouldn't have happened without her tenacity, Cade said. Carter was a “woman of action"" — unsatisfied with just bringing together experts for discussions, she brainstormed ways to change policy by changing attitudes, Cade said, recalling how she'd sit with her advisers and say ""What can we do?

A day after Israel struck aconvoy of ambulancestransporting critically wounded patients from the al-Shifa Hospital to the Rafah border crossing, the Israeli army has intensified its bombardment of the Gaza Strip, hitting schools, mosques and more hospitals. On Saturday morning an Israeli air missile struck the al-Fakhoora school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in the Jabalia refugee camp, killing at least 15 people and injuring 54, according to the Palestinian health ministry. “The number [of deaths] is expected to rise,” said Muhammad Abu Silmeyeh, director of Al-Shifa Hospital. Thousands of people displaced due to Israeli bombing in the Gaza Strip had taken refuge at the al-Fakhoora school. A witness to the attack who lost family members in the bombing told Al Jazeera that four people in their family were killed or injured. “We have nothing to do with anything related to the Hamas movement. The room only had children and women,” the witness added. The attack on the school is the third major attack on the Jabalia camp. It came hours after a deadly strike on the Osama bin Zaid school sheltering displaced families in the al-Saftawi area north of Gaza City, killing at least 20 people, according to local media.      On Saturday morning, the entrance of the al-Nasser Children’s Hospital in western Gaza City was also attacked, and several local media outlets reported civilian casualties. The Health Ministry’s spokesperson has said an estimated 2,200 people, including 1,250 children, are currently buried under the rubble of destroyed buildings in Gaza. Israeli forces also attacked power generators and solar panels atal-Wafa Hospitalin Gaza City, according to local media. An Anadolu agency correspondent reported that the bombing resulted in a significant fire in the hospital courtyard, which was eventually controlled by civil defence teams after several hours. That hospital attack comes a day after the Israeli army attacked the entrance to al-Shifa Hospital and areas surrounding al-Quds Hospital and the Indonesian Hospital. According to journalist Hani Mahmoud in Khan Younis in Gaza’s south, Israeli air attacks have also hit residential homes with solar panels. “This seems to be the last nail in the coffin,” he told Al Jazeera. “What the Israel army wants people to do is to leave. The last source that’s keeping them in Gaza was the tiny bit of electricity they got from the solar panels,” he said. Meanwhile, a water tank in eastern Rafah was also destroyed. “It seems to be another way of telling people, ‘We are going to bomb everything that you rely on for your survival,'” he added. Gaza-based Al-Aqsa TV reported that the public water tank was used to supply several neighbourhoods.      Separately, an Anadolu correspondent reported that the Israeli army bombed two mosques – the Ali bin Abi Talib and the Al-Istijabah mosques – in the al-Sabra neighbourhood, also in southern Gaza. Tamer Qarmout, assistant professor in public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera that this is part of Israel’s war strategy. “There are discussions in Israeli media that the Israeli army will get into phase two of its operations in Gaza starting from next week. This means tactical land operations inside Gaza. So what Israel wants to do before that is to have all the civilians leave to the south,” he said. “So what they’re [Israel’s army] doing is depriving the civilians stuck in northern Gaza from any means of living. So they’ve hit water tanks, hit civil facilities, hospitals and even UNRWA schools where people are taking refuge. Soon, people will be left with no option but to go south,” Qarmout added. He noted that while theIsraeli army had ordered civilians in Gazato temporarily move south since the beginning of its operation on the besieged Strip, many people have stayed because of safety concerns amid the Israeli army’s continuous bombardment of the entire enclave. “People have tried to flee south but the road has been bombed. How can they feel safe if there is no humanitarian corridor to go south?” Qarmout said.  The Israeli army has said that residents of the northern Gaza Strip will be allowed to use Salah al-Din Street, the main road in Gaza, to evacuate south between 11:00 GMT and 14:00 GMT on Saturday. But according to Qarmout, Israel has a history of breaking promises in warfare. “What are the guarantees that Israel still won’t bombard while fleeing south?

Brussels, Belgium –Belgian politicians and officials are increasingly questioning the scale and legality of Israel’s offensive in Gaza, as more civilians are killed and a humanitarian disaster unfolds in the densely populated enclave. On Monday, at a conference in Brussels, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, a liberal democrat, described Israel’s campaign in Gaza as “disproportionate”. “If you bomb an entirerefugee campwith the intention of eliminating a terrorist, I don’t think it’s proportionate,” he said, but insisted that “Belgium will not take sides”. On Wednesday, Belgium’s deputy prime minister made a rare European call forsanctions against Israel. “It’s time,” Petra De Sutter, a Green party politician, told the Flemish newspaper Het Nieuwsblad. “The rain of bombs is inhumane.” De Sutterhas also urged Hamas to release hostages and said money flows to “this terrorist organisation” must be stopped immediately. A day later, Caroline Gennez, Belgium’s minister of development cooperation, suggested that the government was considering recognising the state of Palestine. “This is necessary to achieve peace in the long term,” she told Al Jazeera. And Fourat Ben Chikha, vice president of the Senate of Belgium – the federal parliament’s upper house – told Al Jazeera on Friday that “You don’t need to be a human rights professor or international lawyer to understand that international law is no longer being respected in this war.” He said progressive parties like the Greens, to which he belongs, have begun raising their voices in support of Palestine to build political pressure. “There is no longer any rational reason for the death and violence we are seeing in Gaza. Even for the Israelis whose relatives have been taken as hostages, the bombing of Gaza isn’t helping,” he said. These statements appear in contrast with most leaders in Europe, where few have directly criticised Israel’s bombing campaign that began on October 7, in response to Hamas’s unprecedented attacks. The general European view is that Israel has a right to self-defence, given the horrors of the Hamas incursion, as long as it stays within the boundaries of international law. The Hamas assault killed more than 1,400 Israelis, and saw more than 240 kidnapped. Israel’s attacks, officially aimed at wiping out the Palestinian group that rules Gaza, have killed more than 11,000 people in 34 days, including more than 4,500 children. After De Sutter called for sanctions against Israel, German politician Reinhard Bütikofer wrote on X: “That is not the position of the European Greens.” “The German Greens in particular totally oppose such a move that would blame Israel for the crimes of Hamas who are using civilians as human shields.” But the shifting tone is being welcomed by some. Abdalrahim al-Farra, Palestine’s ambassador to the EU, Belgium and Luxembourg, said he has witnessed “a clear change in the position of the Belgian government”. “We sensed this from the principled and moral stance of Minister Caroline Gennez and Minister Petra De Sutter,” he told Al Jazeera. “Their calls came as a countermeasure to Israel’s violation of international law and international humanitarian law, and the collective punishment on Palestinians.” Al-Farra’s daughter is in Gaza, and some of his relatives were killed in the besieged strip due to Israeli attacks last week. “I am convinced that Belgium’s position will influence many of the positions of some member states,” he said. Les frappes dont sont victimes des civils innocents à Gaza sont disproportionnées et doivent cesser. Et les otages innocents retenus par le Hamas doivent être libérés.pic.twitter.com/GUWOmbMr1I — Alexander De Croo 🇧🇪🇪🇺 (@alexanderdecroo)November 7, 2023  Discussing the Israeli-Palestinian issue can be difficult in Belgium, because of the varying views between political parties in the Flanders in the north, Wallonia in the south, and the Brussels region. Historically, Belgium has been known to show solidarity towards Palestine, while its official stance is also supportive of Israel. Like many in the West, Belgium has not called for a ceasefire in Gaza, despite efforts by left-wingers. At the UN in 2012, the country voted in favour of giving Palestine “non-member” observer status. This year, it supported a UN resolution ordering the International Court of Justice to investigate Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. In 2019, two local governments boycotted a trade mission to Israel. Peter Mertens, general secretary of the Workers Party of Belgium (Partij van de Arbeid van België), said the Belgian government “really has problems” speaking clearly on this matter “because they are being lobbied by Israel, and the lobbying from Washington is even bigger with institutions like NATO headquartered in Belgium.” He said the public and media have been pressuring the government to take a tougher stance against Israel “as the relentless bombardment of Gaza and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians continue”. “We’ve seen the positive announcements like a call for sanctions on Israel, more aid to Gaza and also five million euros ($5.33m) fund to support to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in investigating war crimes. But these calls are not coming from parties like the conservative Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie (N-VA), with some members having strong ties with Israel. “Overall there has been no united stance from Belgium and even our party’s resolution calling for a ceasefire, and for Belgium to recall its ambassador to Israel, was turned down,” Mertens added. Across Belgian cities, solidarity marches have erupted week after week, calling for peace in Palestine and the Israeli hostages to be released. Late last month, Belgian transport workers’ unions issued a statement refusing to load and unload military equipment destined for Israel, “while a genocide is under way in Palestine”. Prominent Belgian activist Anuna De Wever Van der Heyden said Israel’s siege and bombardment of Gaza is fuelling a sense of anger and sorrow. “Israel is losing this war on the ideological and political front. The discussion among [Belgian] government parties is a sign of that,” she told Al Jazeera. Belgian author Christophe Callewart said, “Israel has been delegitimised on a level never seen before. I don’t see how they can ever come back from that.” Artists4Palestine Belgium, trade unions, and other pro-Palestine groups, such as BrusselsAgainstGenocide, are preparing for more Gaza solidarity protests on Saturday.    A post shared by BrusselsAgainstGenocide (@brusselsagainstgenocide)            Follow Al Jazeera English:","PM De Croo describes Israel’s relentless and bloody campaign as ‘disproportionate’, as a left-wing politician calls for sanctions. Brussels, Belgium –Belgian politicians and officials are increasingly questioning the scale and legality of Israel’s offensive in Gaza, as more civilians are killed and a humanitarian disaster unfolds in the densely populated enclave. On Monday, at a conference in Brussels, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, a liberal democrat, described Israel’s campaign in Gaza as “disproportionate”. “If you bomb an entirerefugee campwith the intention of eliminating a terrorist, I don’t think it’s proportionate,” he said, but insisted that “Belgium will not take sides”. On Wednesday, Belgium’s deputy prime minister made a rare European call forsanctions against Israel. “It’s time,” Petra De Sutter, a Green party politician, told the Flemish newspaper Het Nieuwsblad. “The rain of bombs is inhumane.” De Sutterhas also urged Hamas to release hostages and said money flows to “this terrorist organisation” must be stopped immediately. A day later, Caroline Gennez, Belgium’s minister of development cooperation, suggested that the government was considering recognising the state of Palestine. “This is necessary to achieve peace in the long term,” she told News Agency. And Fourat Ben Chikha, vice president of the Senate of Belgium – the federal parliament’s upper house – told News Agency on Friday that “You don’t need to be a human rights professor or international lawyer to understand that international law is no longer being respected in this war.” He said progressive parties like the Greens, to which he belongs, have begun raising their voices in support of Palestine to build political pressure. “There is no longer any rational reason for the death and violence we are seeing in Gaza. Even for the Israelis whose relatives have been taken as hostages, the bombing of Gaza isn’t helping,” he said. These statements appear in contrast with most leaders in Europe, where few have directly criticised Israel’s bombing campaign that began on October 7, in response to Hamas’s unprecedented attacks. The general European view is that Israel has a right to self-defence, given the horrors of the Hamas incursion, as long as it stays within the boundaries of international law. The Hamas assault killed more than 1,400 Israelis, and saw more than 240 kidnapped. Israel’s attacks, officially aimed at wiping out the Palestinian group that rules Gaza, have killed more than 11,000 people in 34 days, including more than 4,500 children. After De Sutter called for sanctions against Israel, German politician Reinhard Bütikofer wrote on X: “That is not the position of the European Greens.” “The German Greens in particular totally oppose such a move that would blame Israel for the crimes of Hamas who are using civilians as human shields.” But the shifting tone is being welcomed by some. Abdalrahim al-Farra, Palestine’s ambassador to the EU, Belgium and Luxembourg, said he has witnessed “a clear change in the position of the Belgian government”. “We sensed this from the principled and moral stance of Minister Caroline Gennez and Minister Petra De Sutter,” he told News Agency. “Their calls came as a countermeasure to Israel’s violation of international law and international humanitarian law, and the collective punishment on Palestinians.” Al-Farra’s daughter is in Gaza, and some of his relatives were killed in the besieged strip due to Israeli attacks last week. “I am convinced that Belgium’s position will influence many of the positions of some member states,” he said.

Officials said the pro-Palestinian organisers calling for a ceasefire in Gaza were gathered ""illegally and violently"".  Demonstrators said they were provoked by police in riot gear who rushed them without warning.  Six officers were treated for injuries and a protester was arrested. Officers said they were pepper sprayed and punched by people in the crowd.  The incident unfolded on the front steps of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington DC, where political leaders, including the highest-ranking House Democrat, had gathered for a reception. Chants of ""ceasefire now"" from roughly 150 activists outside the event resounded in the halls.  Capitol Police swiftly descended on the crowd to block off the building's entrance and exit. Demonstrators said the policing quickly turned aggressive. Video footage of the incident appears to show protesters shouting and screaming as the police barrel in to restrain them.  ""It is shameful the way that nonviolent protesters and members of our community were met with violence tonight,"" Dani Noble, a demonstrator who arrived from Philadelphia, told the Washington Post.  He said police were ""pulling on folks that are disabled or have chronic illnesses, pulling people to the ground"". Inside, police rushed to direct lawmakers to safety. Security has been tightened around the building since pipe bombs were found at both the Democratic and Republican Party headquarters on the eve of the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot. No-one has ever been arrested for the planting of those devices. California congressman Brad Sherman wrote on X, formerly Twitter: ""Was just evacuated from the #DNC after... protestors grew violent, pepper spraying police officers and attempting to break into the building.""  In a statement shared with US media, House Democratic leaders said members of the House Democratic Caucus, aides and guests were participating in an event inside when ""some protesters escalated their activity in a manner that exceeded a peaceful demonstration"". ""We are thankful for the service and professionalism of the US Capitol Police officers who worked to ensure that Members, staff and visitors were able to safely exit,"" the leaders said.  ""We strongly support the First Amendment right to freedom of expression and encourage anyone exercising that right to do so peacefully."" The protest was organised by a coalition of groups, including Jewish Voice for Peace Action and If Not Now, both US Jewish groups who are critical of Israel. The confrontation on Wednesday was the latest in a series of demonstrations across the US, as tensions over the Israel-Gaza war intensify. On Tuesday, thousands of pro-Israel protesters crowded the fields at the National Mall in Washington DC, demanding the release of Hamas-held hostages. A number of rallies have pressed for the US to call for a ceasefire in the conflict, which President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has resisted. On Capitol Hill, many Republicans have rejected the idea of a ceasefire outright.  The militant group Hamas entered Israel on 7 October and killed roughly 1,200 people while kidnapping more than 200 others. In response, Israel has killed more than 11,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run healthy ministry.","Police and protesters clashed outside the Democratic party's national headquarters on Wednesday, forcing dozens of lawmakers to be evacuated. Officials said the pro-Palestinian organisers calling for a ceasefire in Gaza were gathered ""illegally and violently"".  Demonstrators said they were provoked by police in riot gear who rushed them without warning.  Six officers were treated for injuries and a protester was arrested. Officers said they were pepper sprayed and punched by people in the crowd.  The incident unfolded on the front steps of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington DC, where political leaders, including the highest-ranking House Democrat, had gathered for a reception. Chants of ""ceasefire now"" from roughly 150 activists outside the event resounded in the halls.  Capitol Police swiftly descended on the crowd to block off the building's entrance and exit. Demonstrators said the policing quickly turned aggressive. Video footage of the incident appears to show protesters shouting and screaming as the police barrel in to restrain them.  ""It is shameful the way that nonviolent protesters and members of our community were met with violence tonight,"" Dani Noble, a demonstrator who arrived from Philadelphia, told the Washington Post.  He said police were ""pulling on folks that are disabled or have chronic illnesses, pulling people to the ground"". Inside, police rushed to direct lawmakers to safety. Security has been tightened around the building since pipe bombs were found at both the Democratic and Republican Party headquarters on the eve of the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot. No-one has ever been arrested for the planting of those devices. California congressman Brad Sherman wrote on X, formerly Twitter: ""Was just evacuated from the #DNC after... protestors grew violent, pepper spraying police officers and attempting to break into the building.""  In a statement shared with US media, House Democratic leaders said members of the House Democratic Caucus, aides and guests were participating in an event inside when ""some protesters escalated their activity in a manner that exceeded a peaceful demonstration"". ""We are thankful for the service and professionalism of the US Capitol Police officers who worked to ensure that Members, staff and visitors were able to safely exit,"" the leaders said.  ""We strongly support the First Amendment right to freedom of expression and encourage anyone exercising that right to do so peacefully."" The protest was organised by a coalition of groups, including Jewish Voice for Peace Action and If Not Now, both US Jewish groups who are critical of Israel. The confrontation on Wednesday was the latest in a series of demonstrations across the US, as tensions over the Israel-Gaza war intensify. On Tuesday, thousands of pro-Israel protesters crowded the fields at the National Mall in Washington DC, demanding the release of Hamas-held hostages. A number of rallies have pressed for the US to call for a ceasefire in the conflict, which President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has resisted. On Capitol Hill, many Republicans have rejected the idea of a ceasefire outright.

Jaradat said residents in Gaza must be allowed “full, rapid, safe, and unhindered” access to humanitarian aid. “We are working tirelessly with government, worker and employer partners, other UN agencies and humanitarian actors to provide immediate assistance to impacted workers and businesses,” she said. “We will also support them in the longer term towards collecting vital labour market information and recovering jobs and enterprises, combined with social protection initiatives, to the utmost extent of our mandate.” Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade since 2005, suffered from severe economic deprivation even before the start of the latest conflict.

Maine’s highest court is considering a lawsuit asking whether the state's 19th century law, which prevents hunting big game animals such as deer, moose and turkeys on Sundays, is still necessary. In Massachusetts, where hunters are also lobbying for Sunday hunting rights, there is a renewed effort to change state laws forbidding the practice. Forty states have no prohibitions on hunting on Sundays. The bans stem from so-called “blue laws” that also regulate which businesses can remain open and where alcohol can be sold on Sundays. Animal welfare groups, conservation organizations and others are rallying to defend the prohibitions, but the end of the laws might be in sight. Other states such as Virginia and South Carolina have in recent years rolled back what remains of their own limitations on the Sunday hunt. Residents of states where hunting is part of the culture are divided on the subject. Some hunters argue the laws protect private landowner rights, while others say the rules take away hunting opportunities — or are just plain silly. Sportsmen who oppose the laws see them as a vestige of the blue laws dating to the 17th century and limiting what activities citizens can engage in on a day governments once dedicated to prayer. Jared Bornstein, executive director of Maine Hunters United for Sunday Hunting, said allowing seven-day-a-week hunting would allow people the opportunity to harvest their own food in a state with many poor, rural communities that cannot afford soaring grocery costs. ""I'm not saying that Sunday hunting is going to save the world economically, but I'm saying for a group of people, there's more of an objective benefit to it,"" Bornstein said. “It’s a generation’s last vestigial attempt to control the working class.” The states that still have full or partial bans on Sunday hunting are all on the East Coast, where every fall sportsmen pursue wild turkeys and white-tailed deer with firearms and archery. Last year, South Carolina opened limited hunting on public lands on Sundays, and the year before that Virginia made a similar move. A few years prior North Carolina began to allow Sunday hunting on some 75% of its public hunting land, according to the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation. Laws were also loosened in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware in the past five years. Maine's ongoing court case, which could legalize Sunday hunting, concerns a couple who filed a lawsuit stating the “right to food” amendment in the state's Constitution, the first of its kind in the U.S., should allow them to hunt on any day of the week. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court has heard arguments in the case, but it's unclear when it will rule, said Andy Schmidt, an attorney for the couple. The state first banned Sunday hunting in 1883. In Massachusetts, where some sources date the ban all the way back to the Puritan era, a campaign to repeal it made progress before stalling in the state Legislature in 2014. Some are continuing to try to strike the law, which is “discriminating against hunters,” said John Kellstrand, president of the Mass Sportsmen's Council. A new proposal to authorize Sunday hunting via bow and arrows was introduced earlier this year. The efforts to roll back Sunday hunting up and down the East Coast face opposition from a broad range of interest groups, including animal protection advocates, state wildlife management authorities and private landowners. Maine Woodland Owners, a group representing rural landowners in the most forested state in the country, sees the Sunday hunting ban as critical to keeping private lands open for hunting access on the other days of the week, Executive Director Tom Doak said. “We're not asking for money. We're not saying pay us. We're not asking for anything but to be left alone one day a week,” Doak said. “They will close their lands. They absolutely will do that.” Sportsmen's groups, including the National Rifle Association and Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, have long lobbied to overturn Sunday hunting restrictions, and have had much success over the past 30 years. In that time, states including New York, Ohio and Connecticut have loosened Sunday hunting laws. Lifting bans has created hundreds of jobs and millions of dollars in economic activity, said Fred Bird, assistant manager for the northeastern states for the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation. Getting rid of what's left of these laws would remove “a regulation that has no basis in wildlife management,” Bird said. “Simply put, if hunters do not have available days to go afield, they must decide whether their time, energy, and financial resources should continue to be allocated to a pursuit they are unable to fully participate in,” he said. Wildlife managers in states with Sunday hunting have sometimes pushed back at efforts to overturn the bans. The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife testified against a proposal earlier this year that would have allowed Sunday hunting with a bow and arrow or a crossbow. Agricultural, land owner and conservation groups also came out against the proposal, which had support from the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation and some hunters in the state. The Maine Farm Bureau Association testified it's important for land owners to have ""one day of rest without disruption."" The proposal was ultimately voted down in committee. However, the odds of a similar proposal coming before the Maine Legislature again seem high, testified Judy Camuso, commissioner of the wildlife department. “The topic of Sunday hunting has been a heated social debate for years,"" she said.","PORTLAND, Maine --Some states are steadily chipping away at longstanding bans on Sunday hunting, and there's a push to overturn the laws in Maine and Massachusetts, the final two states with full bans. Maine’s highest court is considering a lawsuit asking whether the state's 19th century law, which prevents hunting big game animals such as deer, moose and turkeys on Sundays, is still necessary. In Massachusetts, where hunters are also lobbying for Sunday hunting rights, there is a renewed effort to change state laws forbidding the practice. Forty states have no prohibitions on hunting on Sundays. The bans stem from so-called “blue laws” that also regulate which businesses can remain open and where alcohol can be sold on Sundays. Animal welfare groups, conservation organizations and others are rallying to defend the prohibitions, but the end of the laws might be in sight. Other states such as Virginia and South Carolina have in recent years rolled back what remains of their own limitations on the Sunday hunt. Residents of states where hunting is part of the culture are divided on the subject. Some hunters argue the laws protect private landowner rights, while others say the rules take away hunting opportunities — or are just plain silly. Sportsmen who oppose the laws see them as a vestige of the blue laws dating to the 17th century and limiting what activities citizens can engage in on a day governments once dedicated to prayer. Jared Bornstein, executive director of Maine Hunters United for Sunday Hunting, said allowing seven-day-a-week hunting would allow people the opportunity to harvest their own food in a state with many poor, rural communities that cannot afford soaring grocery costs. ""I'm not saying that Sunday hunting is going to save the world economically, but I'm saying for a group of people, there's more of an objective benefit to it,"" Bornstein said. “It’s a generation’s last vestigial attempt to control the working class.” The states that still have full or partial bans on Sunday hunting are all on the East Coast, where every fall sportsmen pursue wild turkeys and white-tailed deer with firearms and archery. Last year, South Carolina opened limited hunting on public lands on Sundays, and the year before that Virginia made a similar move. A few years prior North Carolina began to allow Sunday hunting on some 75% of its public hunting land, according to the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation. Laws were also loosened in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware in the past five years. Maine's ongoing court case, which could legalize Sunday hunting, concerns a couple who filed a lawsuit stating the “right to food” amendment in the state's Constitution, the first of its kind in the U.S., should allow them to hunt on any day of the week. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court has heard arguments in the case, but it's unclear when it will rule, said Andy Schmidt, an attorney for the couple. The state first banned Sunday hunting in 1883. In Massachusetts, where some sources date the ban all the way back to the Puritan era, a campaign to repeal it made progress before stalling in the state Legislature in 2014. Some are continuing to try to strike the law, which is “discriminating against hunters,” said John Kellstrand, president of the Mass Sportsmen's Council. A new proposal to authorize Sunday hunting via bow and arrows was introduced earlier this year.

The push to try to oust Santos came from fellow GOP lawmakers in the New York delegation, who argue his past lies and embellishments about his personal history and his various legal entanglements make him unfit for office. Santos maintains his innocence after being indicted on a slew of federal charges. Rep. Anthony D'Esposito on Thursday formally filed the expulsion resolution as privileged -- which forced the House to move quickly on Santos' possible removal. D'Esposito was joined by Reps. Mike Lawler, Nick LaLota, Marc Molinaro and Brandon Williams. The resolution needed a two-thirds majority to succeed, but fell well short. The final vote was 179 to 213 with 19 members voting present. Santos defended himself on the House floor ahead of the vote, saying his colleagues were ""prioritizing petty politics."" ""The loss of the presumption of innocence establishes a dangerous precedent that threatens the very foundation of our legal system, and we risk losing the trust that the American people placed in us by passing judgement without due process,"" Santos said. ""If we work together, we can protect the integrity of our system and the rights of all citizens."" ""I'm fighting tooth and nail to clear my name in front of the entire world, Mr. Speaker. It hasn't been easy, but I'm fighting by God's grace,"" he added.  D'Esposito sent a letter from the group to colleagues on Wednesday urging them to back the resolution to force Santos out. ""We strongly urge you to vote in favor of this resolution and encourage you to contact any one of us should you have any doubts about expelling George Santos from this body,"" they wrote. Only five members in U.S. history have been expelled from the House. The last time an expulsion occurred was in 2002, when Ohio Democrat James Traficant was removed after being convicted of 10 felony counts of racketeering, bribery and fraud. Santos hasn't been convicted but is charged with 23 counts as prosecutors allege he stole people's identities, made charges on his campaign donors' credit cards and lied to federal election officials. The congressman pleaded not guilty last week and has repeatedly said he won't step down. His trial is set for 2024. ""I'm strong in my convictions that I can prove my innocence,"" he told reporters last month. Republicans often count on Santos, who represents a swing district on Long Island, to help pass legislation in the House because of the party's single-digit majority. Newly-elected Speaker Mike Johnson has signaled concern that expelling him could endanger that. It wasn't the first time that Santos has been threatened with an expulsion vote.  Democrats tried to force the House to consider an expulsion resolution back in May, when the first set of charges came down against Santos. Republicans avoided that vote, instead choosing to refer the matter to the House Ethics Committee -- which released a rare statement Monday saying they'll announce next steps for their Santos investigation on or before Nov. 17. The committee's investigative subcommittee, which has been reviewing allegations involving Santos, said it ""has contacted 40 witnesses, reviewed more than 170,000 pages of documents and authorized 37 subpoenas.""

… [+5250 chars]",Politics,"As Gaza reels from Israel’s devastating bombardments, here’s a brief history of the conflict using maps and charts. Israel’s deadly bombardment of Gaza has killed nearly 15,000 people, including 10,000 women and children, in over 50 days, making it the deadliest war for the besieged Palestinian enclave till date. Israel has rebuffed calls for a ceasefire as a four-day humanitarian truce comes to an end on November 28. It is unclear whether the truce will be extended. The devastation of Gaza and the mounting death toll has triggered worldwide protests, bringing the decades-long issue to the centre-stage of global politics. The Israeli-Palestinian issue goes back nearly a century when Britain, during World War I, pledged to establish a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine under theBalfour Declaration. British troops took control of the territory from the Ottoman Empire at the end of October 1917.  A large-scale Jewish migration to Palestine began, accelerated by Jewish people fleeing Nazism in Europe. Between 1918 and 1947, the Jewish population in Palestine increased from 6 percent to 33 percent. Palestinians were alarmed by the demographic change and tensions rose, leading to thePalestinian revoltfrom 1936 to 1939. Meanwhile, Zionist organisations continued to campaign for a homeland for Jews in Palestine. Armed Zionist militias started to attack the Palestinian people, forcing them to flee. Zionism, which emerged as a political ideology in the late 19th century, called for the creation of a Jewish homeland.  As violence ravaged Palestine, the matter was referred to the newly formed United Nations. In 1947, the UN adopted Resolution 181, which called for the partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, handing over about55 percentof the land to Jews. Arabs were granted 45 percent of the land, while Jerusalem was declared a separate internationalised territory.  The city is currently divided between West Jerusalem, which is predominantly Jewish, and East Jerusalem with a majority Palestinian population. Israel captured East Jerusalem after the Six-Day War in 1967 along with the West Bank – a step not recognised by the international community. The Old City in occupied East Jerusalem holds religious significance for Christians, Muslims, and Jews. It is home to Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, which is known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as Temple Mount. In 1981, the UN designated it a World Heritage Site.  Leading up to Israel’s birth in 1948, more than 750,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed from their homes by Zionist militias. This mass exodus came to be known as theNakbaor catastrophe. A further 300,000 Palestinians weredisplacedby theSix-Day War in 1967.   Israel declared the annexation of East Jerusalem in 1980, but the international community still considers it an occupied territory. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. In 1993, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed theOslo Accords, which aimed to achieve peace within five years. It was the first time the two sides recognised each other. A second agreement in 1995 divided the occupied West Bank into three parts – Area A, B and C. The Palestinian Authority, which was created in the wake of the Oslo Accords, was offered only limited rule on 18 percent of the land as Israel effectively continued to control the West Bank.  However, the Oslo Accords slowly broke down asIsraeli settlements, Jewish communities built on Palestinian land in the West Bank, grew at a rapid pace. The settlement populationin the West Bank and East Jerusalem grew from approximately 250,000 in 1993 to up to 700,000 in September this year. About three million Palestinians live in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The building of Israeli settlements and aseparation wallon occupied territories has fragmented the the Palestinian communities and restricted their mobility. About 700 road obstacles, including 140 checkpoints, dot the West Bank. About 70,000 Palestinians with Israeli work permits cross these checkpoints in their daily commute. Settlementsare consideredillegal under international law. The UN has condemned settlements, calling ita big hurdlein the realisation of a viable Palestinian state as part of the so-called“two-state solution”.  Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza in 2007 after the Hamas group came to power. The siege continues till date. Israel also occupies the West Bank and East Jerusalem – the territories Palestinians want to be part of their future state. Israel imposeda total blockadeon the Gaza Strip on October 9, cutting its supplies of electricity, food, water, and fuel in the wake ofa surprise Hamas attackinside Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed in that attack.  This is what Israel and Palestine look like now.  Today, about 5 million Palestinians live in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem and 1.6 million Palestinians are citizens of Israel. This makes up about half of their total population. The other half lives in other countries, including Arab countries. There are about 14.7 million Jews around the world today, of which 84 percent live in Israel and the United States. The rest live in other countries including France, Canada, Argentina and Russia.   Here is an account of Palestinian and Israeli lives lost to the violence between 2008 and 2023.

The polls suggest a neck-and-neck race and voting ends at 21:00 (20:00GMT). Centre-right liberal leader Dilan Yesilgöz is tipped to win and become the first female Dutch prime minister. Her closest rivals are anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders and a left-alliance led by former top-ranking EU commissioner Frans Timmermans. More than 13 million Dutch voters have a choice of 26 parties in Wednesday's vote, and as many as 17 could win seats. European eyes are watching this election closely, after 13 years of governments under Mark Rutte. The biggest party could end up with less than 20% of the national vote and fewer than 30 seats in the 150-seat parliament, unprecedented in Dutch politics. Trust in the government is at a low ebb after a political scandal left thousands of parents wrongly labelled as welfare fraudsters. A politician who championed their rights set up a centrist party only three months ago and already he is being cast as kingmaker. Pieter Omtzigt's New Social Contract is likely to be central to forming the next coalition government. He has shown little interest in running the country, but whoever does win will need his support. ""I know what I'm capable of for the Dutch people,"" said Dilan Yesilgöz, who came to the Netherlands as the daughter of Turkish refugees and has made lowering migration levels as much a priority as tackling the high cost of living. Unlike her rivals, she has not ruled out working with Mr Wilders' Freedom Party. But if he wins, she will keep her conservative-liberal VVD party well clear of a Wilders government. When he announced in Tuesday night's final TV debate that he would be a prime minister for all Dutch people, she said that could only happen if he tore up all his policies, such as banning Islam and leaving the EU, dubbed ""Nexit"". Mr Wilders, who has been an MP for 25 years, has offered to put his anti-Islam policies on hold, and said he understands that Dutch voters are not yet ready to leave the EU. ""We have no Nexit in our programme, we have a referendum about Nexit and that's something different,"" he told the BBC. His rhetoric in this election has been mild, says political scientist Martin Rosema, who believes some of the parties could find a way of working with him in government. ""There could be an option that [the Freedom Party] supports the coalition with or without ministers. You usually either a have a majority or a minority [government], but in this case there could be something in-between."" After casting her vote in The Hague, Nurten Demir said that even though Mr Wilders had some good ideas, she could never vote for him: ""If he wasn't so opposed to Muslims, I'd be interested in him. But he's not a democrat."" Despite the extraordinary amount of choice on offer, many voters are apathetic and almost half were said to be undecided even the night before. Turnout with just over three hours of voting remaining was put at 50%, five points down on the 2017 election, according to Ipsos which is conducting the night's big exit polls. Outside another polling station, Renee said 13 years of Rutte-led governments had left too many problems unresolved such as student debt and the climate crisis, and believed one of the smaller parties offered the best alternative. Meanwhile, in one of Rotterdam's poorest neighbourhoods Crooswijk, Drago complained that higher taxes were making life impossible. Like many he believes migration has exacerbated an already difficult housing crisis, which has left the Netherlands with a shortage of 390,000 homes: ""Normal people can't survive. They're waiting 10 years before they can buy a flat."" At a nearby launderette, three female students also voiced concerns about migration but said they would probably vote for the Labour-GreenLeft (PvdA/GL) alliance. Alliance leader Frans Timmermans is confident he has a strong chance of putting together a coalition if he comes first. ""This country can never function without a coalition, it's our history,"" he told the BBC.  ""The left has never been able to govern this country on its own, we always need partners in the centre of politics."" Last year net migration into the Netherlands more than doubled beyond 220,000, partly because of refugees fleeing Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That's why even Pieter Omtzigt's centrist NSC wants a ceiling of 50,000 on migration, and it is one of the reasons why Geert Wilders has been surging in the polls. Far-right rival Thierry Baudet has not enjoyed the same success with the voters. He has fallen behind in the polls and twice came under attack on the campaign trail, ending up in hospital on Monday night after being hit over the head with a beer bottle.

The polls suggest a neck-and-neck race and voting ends at 21:00 (20:00GMT). Centre-right liberal leader Dilan Yesilgöz is tipped to win and become the first female Dutch prime minister. Her closest rivals are anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders and a left-alliance led by former top-ranking EU commissioner Frans Timmermans. More than 13 million Dutch voters have a choice of 26 parties in Wednesday's vote, and as many as 17 could win seats. European eyes are watching this election closely, after 13 years of governments under Mark Rutte. The biggest party could end up with less than 20% of the national vote and fewer than 30 seats in the 150-seat parliament, unprecedented in Dutch politics. Trust in the government is at a low ebb after a political scandal left thousands of parents wrongly labelled as welfare fraudsters. A politician who championed their rights set up a centrist party only three months ago and already he is being cast as kingmaker. Pieter Omtzigt's New Social Contract is likely to be central to forming the next coalition government. He has shown little interest in running the country, but whoever does win will need his support. ""I know what I'm capable of for the Dutch people,"" said Dilan Yesilgöz, who came to the Netherlands as the daughter of Turkish refugees and has made lowering migration levels as much a priority as tackling the high cost of living. Unlike her rivals, she has not ruled out working with Mr Wilders' Freedom Party. But if he wins, she will keep her conservative-liberal VVD party well clear of a Wilders government. When he announced in Tuesday night's final TV debate that he would be a prime minister for all Dutch people, she said that could only happen if he tore up all his policies, such as banning Islam and leaving the EU, dubbed ""Nexit"". Mr Wilders, who has been an MP for 25 years, has offered to put his anti-Islam policies on hold, and said he understands that Dutch voters are not yet ready to leave the EU. ""We have no Nexit in our programme, we have a referendum about Nexit and that's something different,"" he told the News Agency. His rhetoric in this election has been mild, says political scientist Martin Rosema, who believes some of the parties could find a way of working with him in government.

Mumbai, India –As the Indian cricket team move from city to city like a travelling carnival,steamrollering all oppositionin a home World Cup, they are cheered on by packed stadiums of fans in replica blue jerseys, many bearing “Virat 18” on their backs. Meanwhile,Virat Kohli, India’s star batter, is having the time of his life. Kohli has regaled fans with his batting. And when the DJ spins the right tune, he’s also not shy to show off his song-appropriate dance moves, some of them picturised on his wife Anushka Sharma, a famous Bollywood actor and producer. At times the crowds have chanted for Kohli to be given a chance to bowl, and against Netherlands on Sunday night, he did. He obliged by taking a wicket from a dreadful delivery and enjoying every last bit of it with his teammates, fans and wife Anushka who cheered him on from the stands. Amid all this, Kohli ended the league phase as the leading run scorer in the tournament, with 594 runs, getting 50 or more in all but two of nine matches. On occasion, he has strategised with his batting partners to complete his century before the win was sealed. In the shadow of the Western Ghats in Pune, they successfullyengineered a hundredfor him against Bangladesh. Under the snow-capped peaks in Dharamshala against New Zealand, they fell short by five runs. In steamy Kolkata on November 5, the entire stadium sang him happy birthday. Kohli, who turned 35 that day, scored a hundred in India’s victory over South Africa, and in the process, heequalled his hero Sachin Tendulkar’s recordof 49 one-day international centuries. When India last won the World Cup, in 2011, Kohli was 23. During the celebratory lap around the field in Mumbai that night, he famously hoisted Tendulkar on his shoulders and supplied a memorable quote to the cameras: “He’s carried the burden of the nation for 21 years, so it’s time we carry him on our shoulders.” If India go on to win this World Cup, it is not out of the question for Kohli to be the one hoisted in Ahmedabad. In the 12 years between then and now, he has acquired a status that few in the sport ever have. To the outside world Kohli is an icon for Indian cricket. Within India he has come to represent something greater: excellence itself. There are, first of all, the runs: a staggering 26,000-plus and counting in international cricket, already the fourth highest of all time. There is the legacy of his captaincy (which ended, undercontroversial circumstances, in 2022). Although India did not land a global trophy in that time, his 63 percent win record across formats compares with the best in history. During his captaincy, the Test team held the number one ranking for three-and-a-half years straight. But to understand the phenomenon of Kohli in contemporary India, we have to consider, too, the impact of “Brand Kohli”. For four of the past five years he has been placed first in Kroll’s Celebrity Brand Valuation reports for Indian celebrities, ahead of a bevvy of film actors (his latest valuation is $177m). No fewer than 372 million people subscribe to his social media feeds. If put together, an agglomeration of Kohli followers would make the third biggest country in the world. Whilewelcoming cricket into the Olympics, the LA Games Sports Director Niccolo Campriani pointed out that Kohli’s following is “more than LeBron James, Tom Brady and Tiger Woods combined”. Santosh Desai, a leading Indian advertising professional and columnist, teased out the elements of “Brand Kohli” for Al Jazeera: “There is grit, a kind of fierce determination”; “a combination of hot-bloodedness and internal discipline”; “a certain hardness and masculinity”; “aggression is an important part, directed both at himself and outside”. If these adjectives feel at odds with his carefree demeanour on display at the World Cup, there is reason. Age, fatherhood, freedom from captaincy, have all had a (slightly) mellowing effect on the most relentlessly intense figure Indian cricket has known, whose in-your-face competitiveness – celebrations like road rage – could rub not just the opposition the wrong way but some of his own countrymen too. Desai says there has been brand evolution since his marriage to Anushka: “a definite attempt to dull some of the harder edges of his persona”. Indian viewers often receive Kohli in carefully curated ways, especially on Star Sports, the broadcasters of the 2023 World Cup. Kohli-specific programming has been a staple during their tournament coverage. The WeForVirat series documents aspects of his life and career. Believe: The Diwali Miracle, a two-part series, is dedicated to a single T20 innings against Pakistan. In Wrogn Lessons (Wrogn is a clothing brand Kohli co-owns), Kohli reveals his intimate side as he talks about his mum and missing his daughter. Whereas on the chat show Virat Unplugged, he winsomely banters with a social media influencer. It’s not all adulation. Unexpected blowback came this weekend, when a leading trend on X in India attacked Star Sports for being a “PR agency” for Kohli, and more specifically, for not giving play to the captain and fellow batting stalwart, Rohit Sharma. It was a storm in a teacup. Worldly success – fame that is easily worn; wealth that is directed into such business investments as a plant-based meats company, a gymnasium chain, the football club Goa FC – only burnishes Kohli’s credentials as a sporting superachiever.

Mumbai, India –As the Indian cricket team move from city to city like a travelling carnival,steamrollering all oppositionin a home World Cup, they are cheered on by packed stadiums of fans in replica blue jerseys, many bearing “Virat 18” on their backs. Meanwhile,Virat Kohli, India’s star batter, is having the time of his life. Kohli has regaled fans with his batting. And when the DJ spins the right tune, he’s also not shy to show off his song-appropriate dance moves, some of them picturised on his wife Anushka Sharma, a famous Bollywood actor and producer. At times the crowds have chanted for Kohli to be given a chance to bowl, and against Netherlands on Sunday night, he did. He obliged by taking a wicket from a dreadful delivery and enjoying every last bit of it with his teammates, fans and wife Anushka who cheered him on from the stands. Amid all this, Kohli ended the league phase as the leading run scorer in the tournament, with 594 runs, getting 50 or more in all but two of nine matches. On occasion, he has strategised with his batting partners to complete his century before the win was sealed. In the shadow of the Western Ghats in Pune, they successfullyengineered a hundredfor him against Bangladesh. Under the snow-capped peaks in Dharamshala against New Zealand, they fell short by five runs. In steamy Kolkata on November 5, the entire stadium sang him happy birthday. Kohli, who turned 35 that day, scored a hundred in India’s victory over South Africa, and in the process, heequalled his hero Sachin Tendulkar’s recordof 49 one-day international centuries. When India last won the World Cup, in 2011, Kohli was 23. During the celebratory lap around the field in Mumbai that night, he famously hoisted Tendulkar on his shoulders and supplied a memorable quote to the cameras: “He’s carried the burden of the nation for 21 years, so it’s time we carry him on our shoulders.” If India go on to win this World Cup, it is not out of the question for Kohli to be the one hoisted in Ahmedabad. In the 12 years between then and now, he has acquired a status that few in the sport ever have. To the outside world Kohli is an icon for Indian cricket. Within India he has come to represent something greater: excellence itself. There are, first of all, the runs: a staggering 26,000-plus and counting in international cricket, already the fourth highest of all time. There is the legacy of his captaincy (which ended, undercontroversial circumstances, in 2022). Although India did not land a global trophy in that time, his 63 percent win record across formats compares with the best in history. During his captaincy, the Test team held the number one ranking for three-and-a-half years straight. But to understand the phenomenon of Kohli in contemporary India, we have to consider, too, the impact of “Brand Kohli”. For four of the past five years he has been placed first in Kroll’s Celebrity Brand Valuation reports for Indian celebrities, ahead of a bevvy of film actors (his latest valuation is $177m). No fewer than 372 million people subscribe to his social media feeds. If put together, an agglomeration of Kohli followers would make the third biggest country in the world. Whilewelcoming cricket into the Olympics, the LA Games Sports Director Niccolo Campriani pointed out that Kohli’s following is “more than LeBron James, Tom Brady and Tiger Woods combined”. Santosh Desai, a leading Indian advertising professional and columnist, teased out the elements of “Brand Kohli” for News Agency: “There is grit, a kind of fierce determination”; “a combination of hot-bloodedness and internal discipline”; “a certain hardness and masculinity”; “aggression is an important part, directed both at himself and outside”. If these adjectives feel at odds with his carefree demeanour on display at the World Cup, there is reason. Age, fatherhood, freedom from captaincy, have all had a (slightly) mellowing effect on the most relentlessly intense figure Indian cricket has known, whose in-your-face competitiveness – celebrations like road rage – could rub not just the opposition the wrong way but some of his own countrymen too. Desai says there has been brand evolution since his marriage to Anushka: “a definite attempt to dull some of the harder edges of his persona”. Indian viewers often receive Kohli in carefully curated ways, especially on Star Sports, the broadcasters of the 2023 World Cup. Kohli-specific programming has been a staple during their tournament coverage. The WeForVirat series documents aspects of his life and career. Believe: The Diwali Miracle, a two-part series, is dedicated to a single T20 innings against Pakistan. In Wrogn Lessons (Wrogn is a clothing brand Kohli co-owns), Kohli reveals his intimate side as he talks about his mum and missing his daughter. Whereas on the chat show Virat Unplugged, he winsomely banters with a social media influencer. It’s not all adulation. Unexpected blowback came this weekend, when a leading trend on X in India attacked Star Sports for being a “PR agency” for Kohli, and more specifically, for not giving play to the captain and fellow batting stalwart, Rohit Sharma. It was a storm in a teacup. Worldly success – fame that is easily worn; wealth that is directed into such business investments as a plant-based meats company, a gymnasium chain, the football club Goa FC – only burnishes Kohli’s credentials as a sporting superachiever. Former England captain Nasser Hussain once asked Duncan Fletcher, who had coached both England and India, for his take on Kohli. “He’s a winner,” was Fletcher’s pithy response. It is what a young, aspirational nation looks up to. Well played Virat.It took me 365 days to go from 49 to 50 earlier this year.

Stripmageddon? It is clearly causing a lot of uproar.” “But this is a different kind of big event,” said Green, who remembers two Grand Prix races held 42 years ago at Caesars Palace. “We’re talking about billionaires from around the world. They’re going to bring in a ton of money. They’re not necessarily the usual tourist.” Organizers, local officials and hotel operators believe the discomfort will be forgotten after racing ends late Saturday. They hope Las Vegas will join Monaco on the leader board of host cities for Grand Prix events around the world. But predictions of sold-out seats and peak demand for the most expensive grand prix on the F1 calendar may have been overly optimistic. Tickets were still available this week and some hotels have slashed room rates. Post-race, officials say the Venetian gondola canal will be refilled and casino operator MGM Resorts International has promised to replace Bellagio sidewalk shade trees removed to frame the fountains with thousands of grandstand seats and skybox suites. One worker died during construction. “I know a lot of people love the fountains,” Joshua Guray, a visitor from Long Beach, California, said. “So it’s definitely a bummer, I’d say.” For now, many familiar Strip sights are blocked by track barriers, fencing, pedestrian walkway screens, scaffolding and advertising erected around the nighttime race on streets usually choked with taxis, buses and rental cars and lined by pedestrians posing for selfies. “It’s all barricades and things blocking traffic,” said Charles Flexer, a tourist from Williamsport, Pennsylvania, who tried to decide how to cross Las Vegas Boulevard with his mother using an electric mobility scooter. “It's very disruptive.” When the inaugural Formula One Las Vegas grand prix was added to a 24-race worldwide F1 schedule a year ago, tickets and hotel packages costing tens of thousands of dollars per person went on sale. Organizers won a 10-year permit for the race. After road work began in April, race organizers asked Clark County to contribute half of an estimated $80 million in repaving costs. Jim Gibson, chairman of the elected body with jurisdiction over the Las Vegas Strip, said last week that talks about who pays what will continue after the race. “Formula One is in a class all its own” Gibson said. “By any standards, it’s been a very heavy lift for our community to take the steps necessary to have a successful event. Everyone who lives here, who works in the resort corridor in particular, has had to sacrifice because of the significant roadwork and construction."" Officials now also acknowledge that parking spots will be scarce for race fans and hotel workers alike. “If guests don’t have a ticket or a designated destination, it might not be the best place to come on the weekend,” Vanessa Anthes, vice president of event operations for the race organization, told reporters. Police are ""planning for this like it’s New Year’s Eve,” Clark County Undersheriff Andrew Walsh said as he listed restrictions on pedestrian access and the size of backpacks and purses. Las Vegas police have exercised Strip closures for New Year’s Eve fireworks every year since the last night of 2000. Officials say it now draws more than 300,000 people annually. “We’re no stranger to handling large-scale events,"" Walsh said. The department also has managed nighttime Strip marathons, and recent championship parades and rallies for the NHL Vegas Golden Knights and WNBA Las Vegas Aces. The city hosts overnight outdoor music festivals — one covering several downtown blocks — and NASCAR races at the 80,000-seat Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Next February, it will host the NFL Super Bowl at Allegiant Stadium. The city also bears painful memories of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. A gunman opened fire in October 2017 from windows in a high-rise hotel into an outdoor concert crowd of 20,000 people, killing 58 and himself before police reached him. At least two people died later from their wounds. The Las Vegas Grand Prix is expected to draw more than 100,000 fans for practice, qualifying and featured races — 50 laps with the world's elite drivers racing open-cockpit vehicles on a 3.8-mile (6.1-kilometer) road course. Racers will start at a newly constructed permanent grandstand-and-pit facility and snake past the recently opened Sphere before hitting a 1.18-mile (1.89-kilometer) straightaway down the Strip at speeds expected to top 200 mph (322 kph). The world's most sophisticated sports cars will blur past properties including Wynn, Harrah’s, Flamingo, Horseshoe, Paris Las Vegas, Planet Hollywood and Cosmopolitan. More than a dozen high-rise hotels along the race route offer a combined 40,000-plus guest rooms. In addition to the Sphere, the interior track area includes Caesars Entertainment's High Roller observation wheel. In years to come, the fire-spewing volcano at the track-side Mirage resort is slated to be replaced by a huge guitar-shaped hotel tower built by the new owner of the property, Hard Rock International and the Florida-based Seminole Tribe. Racing starts at 10 p.m. local time. Officials project the event will draw more than $1 billion to a local economy that aims to fill 152,000 hotel rooms. Rates in September averaged $201.50 per night. Earlier, amid race-week premiums, Caesars Palace offered a five-night stay overlooking the course from its Nobu Sky Villa at $5 million. “If you were a Grand Prix devotee and you came here for the event in the early 80s, and this is the next time you visited, you’re in for a shock,” said Green, who was a young newspaper reporter when Caesars Palace hosted two years of F1 racing. That course included the casino parking lot near where Evel Knievel spectacularly crashed in 1967 while trying to jump his motorcycle over the hotel fountain. Green remembered Las Vegas Boulevard casino-hotels including the Dunes, Barbary Coast, Frontier, Silver Slipper, Sands, Desert Inn and Stardust. All are now gone, replaced by destination resorts boasting celebrity chef restaurants, shopping, headline nightclubs and periodic resident entertainers.

As 16-year-old Jamal Bhuyan woke from a coma, in his mind, it was still Friday, November 17, 2006. He had a game on Saturday for FC Copenhagen’s youth team and needed to tell the coach that he wouldn’t be available. Rather than passing him the phone, the nurse handed him a newspaper. It was now Sunday, and splashed across the pages of the paper was none other than Bhuyan himself. “She said, ‘You got shot two days ago. Don’t worry, everybody knows that you’re here,’” he recalled. Bhuyan was shot four times, one bullet narrowly missing his heart, after he was caught in the crossfire of gang-related gunfire in the suburbs of the Danish capital. He was lucky to still be alive. Then a promising footballer in the youth side of one of Denmark’s biggest clubs and on the verge of breaking into the senior team, that fateful Friday afternoon stopped his fledgling career in its tracks. He spent four lonely months in hospital during an arduous recovery process. “The doctors told me: ‘You’re not going to play football ever again,'” the now 33-year-old told Al Jazeera in an online interview. Despite undergoing 12 surgeries and still suffering from the effects of the shooting – he has limited feeling and movement in his right hand – being a footballer was his dream and he refused to walk away. Known as a tough defensive midfielder, before moving into a more attacking role more recently, Bhuyan has gone on to become Bangladesh’s record appearance-maker, with more than 75 caps since his international debut in 2013, and became captain in 2018. Jamie Day, his former national team coach, told Al Jazeera that Bhuyan’s achievements are remarkable, especially given his experiences and background. “I think that shows the character and the type of person that he is, he’s a fighter,” Day said. “He’s shown in life that you have to battle. But if you do that and you’re fully focused, and there’s determination and drive that you can achieve anything you want.”      Bhuyan grew up in Brondby Nord, a rough neighbourhood in the outer suburbs of the Danish capital, with his parents, both migrants from Bangladesh, and two older brothers. It was these roots that formed the foundations for his new career, one based in Dhaka rather than Denmark. Although he defied the odds to return to the football pitch, he had to start over in the lower levels of Danish football, before he received an offer to join Abahani Limited Dhaka, one of Bangladesh’s biggest clubs, in 2012. Fast forward to 2023 and Bhuyan is now one of the country’s most recognisable sports stars. “Jamal is arguably the most popular [Bangladeshi] footballer of his generation,” Dhaka-based journalist Atique Anam said. “His presentability, upbringing, stories of his time in Denmark, his communication skills and experience make him the ideal marketable product in football, which otherwise suffers from a lack of interest from sponsors. “Jamal was the first footballer in the national team who grew up outside the country. He had difficulties coping with the culture here initially, but over the last 10 years, he got settled and evolved as the leader.” Life in Dhaka, one of the world’s most densely populated cities, can be suffocating at the best of times. When you’re one of the country’s most popular athletes, that suffocation can be overwhelming. “After I became captain, the whole scenario changed for me,” Bhuyan said. “What I was used to, to go out and be myself, I didn’t have that freedom any more, especially in Dhaka. When I go outside in Dhaka people knock on the car, they will do anything. They will wait for me in front of the hotel. “You know, I came from nothing, and suddenly I became very, very well-known in my own country. So, for me, it was a big change. “And of course when you’re the captain of the football team, you’re like the face of football in Bangladesh. So wherever I go, I get recognised and for me it’s positive and it’s nice, but sometimes it can also kill your freedom to go places.” Despite the attention, Day said being the face and leader of Bangladesh comes easily to Bhuyan. “He’s a good leader, he obviously leads by example,” Day, who coached Bangladesh between 2018 and 2022, said. “But he will let other players know if they’re not pulling their weight. “He is very approachable for the players. He’s easy to talk to and get on with, but he does expect high standards from everyone on and off the pitch.” Bangladesh are currently ranked 183rd in the official FIFA rankings, and while football is popular, it is a distant second to cricket. Bhuyan believes Bangladeshi football is now focusing its development efforts in the right areas – building more facilities like stadiums and training pitches, and developing the grassroots game. “Still, we have a long way to go, but we are on a good track right now compared to five or six years ago,” he said. Not content with being just the national team captain, Bhuyan is now something of an unofficial ambassador for his country in Argentina thanks to his historic move to Club Sol de Mayo in the third tier of Argentinian football in August, when he became the first Bangladeshi player to sign for an Argentinian club. The Bangladeshi love affair with Argentinian football dates back to 1986, before Bhuyan was even born, when the South Asian country became transfixed by Diego Maradona and his World Cup-winning performances for La Albiceleste. Bangladesh’s fanatical support for Argentina came to prominence again during last year’sWorld Cup in Qatarand led to Argentina reopening its embassy in Dhaka, which had been closed since 1978. Bhuyan was present at the reopening ceremony, exchanging jerseys with Santiago Cafiero, Argentina’s foreign minister. After moving to Argentina, he was also afforded a meeting with Chiqui Tapia, the president of the Argentina Football Association. “I remember when I landed in Buenos Aires, there were around 200 Bangladeshis at the airport with big banners and flags,” he said. “I think that the club president was so surprised and overwhelmed about it because I don’t think he realised that he would be able to get so much attention. “Even to my first match, it was full of Bengali people. I think 80 percent of the crowd was from Bangladesh. So I was very honoured and very proud. “I even know that the club used to play in white and blue coloured jerseys, but because of me, they changed the colour to green. So that’s crazy.” As much as it comes with challenges, don’t ask Bhuyan as to whether his status as a leader comes with any extra pressure. “I don’t know about the word pressure,” he said. “Those who have pressure in life are those people who don’t have food on the table … there’s a lot of poor people in Bangladesh that I’ve seen with my own eyes. They don’t have food, they don’t have money. So I think those kinds of people have pressure. “I feel a responsibility to perform well and a responsibility to lead my team and to do my best for my team.” The responsibility of leading his country continues this week as Bangladesh resume their dual qualification process for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup. As one of Asia’s lowest-ranked teams, their journey started last month with a narrow 3-2 aggregate victory over the Maldives.

Even qualifying for the Asian Cup would be a stunning achievement. Instead, their targets are somewhat smaller. “I think the main goal is to be able to compete with teams who are much higher ranked than us and to give good performances,” he said from Melbourne where the Bengal Tigers will face Australia on Thursday evening in the opener for a tough qualifying group that also includes Lebanon and Palestine. “Of course, if we are able to steal some points and maybe get a win or two, then for us, it will be brilliant.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","Bhuyan talks to News Agency about his rise to stardom in Bangladesh, his move to Argentina, and upcoming World Cup qualifiers. As 16-year-old Jamal Bhuyan woke from a coma, in his mind, it was still Friday, November 17, 2006.

Bidding for a place in history as the woman who made Paris green, she has promised another city referendum. The vote next February will be on whether to increase parking fees for so-called sports utility vehicles. If last April's e-scooter referendum is anything to go by, the mayor should be confident of another easy victory.  On that occasion only a fraction of the electorate turned out, and they were in their vast majority people who actively hated e-scooters.    For SUVs, Ms Hidalgo has promised that residents of Paris proper will not be affected. In any case, ownership of SUVs - and of cars in general - is relatively low inside the capital's 20 arrondissements or districts. So opposition will be minimal. Rather, the people most inconvenienced by higher parking fees are suburbanites who drive SUVs into Paris for work or pleasure. Handily, they won't be voting. The 64-year-old Socialist had been promising a new initiative to build on the e-scooter ban.   But the timing has raised suspicions that she's using it to divert attention from her own SUV - as in Startlingly Unnecessary Voyage. Opposition council members in Paris City Hall scent blood over a two-week trip taken by Anne Hidalgo to New Caledonia and French Polynesia in the South Pacific in October. The first half of the visit was supposedly on official business, but from 21 October she stayed on in order to visit her daughter living on the Polynesian island of Raiatea.  It did not help that her absence coincided with the aftermath of the 7 October attacks in Israel, when back in Paris there were serious worries about the Middle East conflict spilling on to the streets.  The mayor's office has issued a strongly worded denial that there was anything untoward about the trip. It says that extending official visits for personal reasons is an accepted practice, and that Ms Hidalgo paid for the second part of her sojourn as well as the return air-fare. Officially the aim of the visit was first to pay respects at a cemetery in New Caledonia, where deportees from the Paris 1871 commune are buried. The cemetery is paid for by the city of Paris. Then in French Polynesia the mayor and her party held a number of meetings with local elected officials, before viewing the famous surf spot at Teahupo'o which will be used in next year's Paris Olympics. Except that that culminating moment of the visit never took place, because of local protests over the environmental cost of a new Olympic viewing platform. Back in Paris, the reaction from right-wing members of the Paris Assembly has been anything but pacific.  ""I'll give you savings - €60,000 of savings,"" said right-wing councillor David Alphand in a debate Tuesday on the city's heavily indebted budget. The mayor's visit cost just under €60,000 (£52,300). ""Who can honestly say that this trip to the other end of the world was in any way appropriate? Only Madame Hidalgo herself cannot see there is a problem."" For the opposition, there was no justification for Ms Hidalgo going to see the Olympic site, because the minister of sport and the head of the Olympics committee - people who are far more involved in actually organising the Games - had already been there. The environmental cost of the trip did not go unnoticed either. ""There's something seriously indecent about pointing the finger at a nurse or a builder who has to use their car to come into Paris, when at the same time you're explaining how it was absolutely essential to fly 30,000km in an airplane,"" said opposition councillor Nelly Garnier.","Flush from this year's victory over banning rental electric scooters, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has a new on-street target in her sights: SUVs.

Be it the recent Asian Games or the ongoing cricket World Cup, Indians are spurred into a frenzy by match wins and medal count, but adopting it as a profession is rarely a motivation. A single-minded focus on academics is served as an ultimatum to children, and any mention of pursuing sports is actively discouraged. The parents’ attitude is understandable since sports, apart from cricket, has hardly ever offered sufficient financial remuneration or stability to be considered a profession. Even if it does, the career span may be too short to provide a lifetime of financial support. Of late, however, several sports other than cricket have come into the limelight, be it tennis, badminton, chess or athletic events. The government, too, has come up with initiatives and  financial support  to promote players in various sporting events. So if your children are keen to opt for sports as a career, here are some things to keep in mind. First, consider it only if your child shows keen interest and flair in the sport, and is willing to put in the discipline and hard work it entails. Don’t initiate it as an experiment till the time the child is ready for higher education. The child may lose focus and interest in both. Be prepared and willing to accept that attention to a sport as a full-time profession will result in some form of educational neglect, especially if the child is doing well in his sport. While some form of educational qualification and grounding is a good idea, do not push him to  excel  in both. Next, be prepared for financial investment in the sport from an early age. As opposed to a large corpus required for the child’s higher education at about 17-18 years of age, you will need to start spending right from the beginning of his training. The expenses will include funds for sporting equipment and gear, nutritional needs, health check-ups and medical expenses, professional training and coaching, sports camps, tournaments and frequent travelling. These expenses will continue till the time the child starts winning tournaments and earning monetary awards. So your financial planning will need to take care of staggered expenses over a longer time frame. Also keep in mind that this will be in addition to the education expenses for the child, at least in the early stages of schooling. Third, if you are serious about the professional elevation of your child in a sporting event, at least one of the parents will need to put their careers on hold or, at the very least, take time out from their professional and work commitments. As you accompany the child for his training and tournaments, you will need to take leave of absence or modify your work arrangements. When the child starts earning, you will also need to manage his savings and investments till the time he becomes an adult. This may be key, especially for sports with limited career spans and earning potential. While it may a good idea to teach him the basics of saving and investing, it would be best to hire a good financial planner so that the money can be put to work to last longer and take care of dips in career. Finally, it’s important to remember that every child may not achieve professional excellence. In such a case, inform the child about alternative career options in sports, be it coaching, training, sports writing or journalism for him to pursue. IF YOU HAVE A WEALTH WHINE, WRITE TO US...

Finally, it’s important to remember that every child may not achieve professional excellence. In such a case, inform the child about alternative career options in sports, be it coaching, training, sports writing or journalism for him to pursue. IF YOU HAVE A WEALTH WHINE, WRITE TO US...

After coming under fire for its links to China, TikTok is again under the spotlight in the United States amid claims that the popular video app is pushing young people to support Palestinians and Hamas. In recent weeks, powerful politicians, including senators Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio and House Representative Mike Gallagher, have reiterated calls for a ban on TikTok, citing the app’s alleged bias towards anti-Israel and anti-Jewish content. “While data security issues are paramount, less often discussed is TikTok’s power to radically distort the world picture that America’s young people encounter. Israel’s unfolding war with Hamas is a crucial test case,” Hawley said in a letter to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday. Hawley cited a recent Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll in which 51 percent of Americans aged 18-24 said that Hamas’s October 7 attacks on Israel could be justified by Palestinians’ grievances, in contrast to older Americans who overwhelmingly back Israel. “Analysts have attributed this disparity to the ubiquity of anti-Israel content on TikTok, where most young internet users get their information about the world,” Hawley said. Rubio said last month that TikTok was among a number of platforms that had become “cesspools of [pro-Hamas] misinformation and indoctrination” and a vehicle for “brainwashing”. TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has long been in the crosshairs of US lawmakers overclaims that the app promotes Beijing’s agenda,including by suppressing content on sensitive issues like Taiwan and the repression of Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang. Democrats and Republicans introduced several bills aimed at banning or restricting TikTok, but those efforts have stalled due to free speech concerns. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, TikTok’s influence has been thrust back into the public arena amid scrutiny of the prominence of pro-Palestinian content. Last month, American venture capitalist Jeff Morris Jr wrote a lengthy series of posts on X alleging that the app’s algorithm was corrupting young people by swaying them from the traditionally pro-Israel stance of most Americans. Morris Jr expressed alarm that the hashtag “#standwithpalestine” had three billion views, compared with 200 million for “#standwithisrael”. “When I engaged with one post on TikTok supporting opposing views, my entire feed became aggressively anti-Israel,” he said, adding it was as if he was “told to see this war with Israel being the evil side”. “Because the TikTok narrative is now so anti-Israel, the engagement flywheel encourages creators to support that narrative because it’s getting the most attention, and creating anti-Israel content helps them increase their following.” TikTok did not provide a comment when contacted by Al Jazeera but has previously stated that it “stands against terrorism” and removes hateful and violent content. TikTok said in a statement last week that it had removed more than 925,000 videos in the conflict region for “violating our policies around violence, hate speech, misinformation, and terrorism, including content promoting Hamas”, and millions of more posts globally. TikTok’s publicly viewable user data suggest a greater affinity for the Palestinian cause among users in the US, although pro-Israel content is also popular on the site. In the 30 days leading up to November 8, about 6,000 posts with 55 million views used the hashtag #standwithisrael, whereas some 13,000 posts with 37 million views used #standwithpalestine. The hashtag #freepalestine dwarfed both, being featured in 177,000 posts with 946 million views. None of the hashtags about the conflict cracked the top 100 over the period, during which the app was dominated by content related to Halloween, a meme about Ohio, and the film adaption of the video game Five Nights at Freddy’s. Globally, pro-Palestine content overwhelmingly dominated with #freepalestine and #standwithpalestine racking up 11 billion and one billion views, respectively. “TikTok needs to get more serious about content moderation,” Darrell West, a senior fellow at the Governance Studies Center for Technology at the Brookings Institution, told Al Jazeera. “Disinformation is being spread through videos on its platforms and inflaming public tensions on all sides of the issue. It needs human moderators who check the authenticity of the videos and make sure blatant lies are not being spread.” In the US, the tilt towards pro-Palestinian content appears to reflect a generational shift that has been under way since well before the Israel-Hamas war. In a 2022 survey by Pew Research, 61 percent of Americans aged 18-29 years said they viewed Palestinian people either “very favourably” or “somewhat favourably”, compared with the national average of 52 percent. When asked the same questions about Israelis, 56 percent of 18 to 29-year-olds said they viewed them favourably versus the average of 67 percent. The rise in pro-Palestinian sentiment has been an especially fraught issue on university campuses, where divestment and boycott campaigns directed at Israel are popular. The Anti-Defamation League reported 665 “anti-Israel incidents” on campuses from June 2022 to May 2023 and has expressed concern about a “growing, radical movement to place opposition of Israel and Zionism as core elements of college life”. Last month, student groups at Harvard University sparked a backlash after releasing a letter saying that Israel was “entirely responsible for all unfolding violence” due to its treatment of the Palestinians. Three law students at Harvard and Columbia University who signed the letter lost job offers following the controversy. Edward Ahmed Mitchell, the national deputy director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said that while there are legitimate concerns about TikTok, the prominence of pro-Palestinian content on the platform is not among them. “It is nothing short of hypocritical for politicians to want to restrict access to a social media platform because it dares to allow people to freely express their support for Palestinian human rights in a way that other social media platforms do not,”  Mitchell told Al Jazeera. “Young people have also been exposed to the world and receive their news directly through social media in many cases – not through the filter of mainstream media,” he added. “Therefore, if you have young people growing up for 10 years learning about Palestine directly from the victims of these continuous human rights violations, it’s no surprise that people are more sympathetic to the Palestinian people.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","US lawmakers renew calls to restrict app amid anxiety about growing pro-Palestinian views among young people.

Claims and denials of a potential ceasefire in Gaza continue. Some reports refer to athree-day pause in fighting, while others extend the truce to a full five days. Still, others claim the ceasefire could begin imminently. And so on. Even statements from the horse’s mouth differ. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied the report published by The Washington Post on Saturday that a tentative deal had been reached; a United States representative confirmed that talks were continuing but that a breakthrough was still awaited. On Sunday,Qatar’s Prime MinisterSheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani announced in Doha that the differences remaining between Hamas and Israel were “very minor”. Qatar has been central to mediation efforts in the war, including for the release of Israeli captives. The last to be heard on the subject was Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh who on Tuesday told Reuters news agency that the parties are “close to reaching a truce agreement”. Another Hamas official told Al Jazeera that negotiations were centred on the duration of the truce, details of aid delivery to Gaza and the exchange of hostages and prisoners. Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. With most parties involved looking to temporarily halt the carnage in Gaza, one must hope for the small step to a temporary respite. It is also prudent to examine why the two warring sides are considering such a hiatus. While such a pause would benefit Hamas politically, militarily there seems to be no obvious gain — as I’ll explain on Wednesday. For Israel, on the other hand, pausing the war could be advantageous from a military point of view and disadvantageous from a political one. The Israeli war machine has been going at full strength for six weeks in the air and three weeks on the ground in Gaza. Since the Hamas attacks, Israel’saerial bombardmenthas continued at a surprisingly high rate. It was clear from day one that the primary purpose of such merciless pounding of Palestinian civilian targets was not military. Initially, many analysts believed that the intense aerial attacks served to demonstrate to the Israeli populace that the armed forces were doing something and that bombing would be eased once land forces moved in. Even a country that boasts of its preparedness for war needs to maintain substantial reserves of weapons and ammunition. Omar Bradley, a US Army general during World War II, once said “amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics”. Israeli forward commanders may be eager to continue pounding Gaza come what may, but the rear echelon has done the maths and does not like the result. There are reliable reports escaping the net of military secrecy that the Israeli Air Force (IAF) is running out of smart bombs. It is always difficult to judge the credibility of allegations in military matters. Sometimes an officer who is disillusioned with his side — especially when it is fighting outside its borders or inflicting heavy civilian losses — will anonymously leak crucial details. Several specialised online forums claim that the IAF, having expended more than 2,500 joint direct attack munition (JDAM) smart bomb kits over Gaza, has just 10 days of stocks remaining. Every military regulates how much ammunition must remain in reserve for emergencies. Exact figures are a guarded secret, but everything points to Israel’s quartermasters having sounded alarms, asking for urgent replenishment. Specialised military items can be bought to fill gaps. In 1973, when Israel was on the verge of running out of stocks fighting Syria, Egypt and their Arab allies, the US launched “Operation Nickel Grass”, the biggest military airlift in history. The US Air Force flew almost 1,000 tonnes of weapons and ammunition to Israel per day, for a total of more than 22,000 tonnes. That isbeing repeated now, albeit on a smaller scale. For the past two weeks, US C-17 transports have been landing regularly at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv and at Nevatim airbase in the Negev desert. Most aircraft fly in from the Ramstein airbase in Germany, where the US has warehouses full of “prepositioned stock” — equipment set aside for military emergencies. There is little doubt that heavier and less urgent supplies are beingshipped to Israel by sea. Among them will surely be replenishment rockets for the tracked version of the high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), the M270 multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) that saw heavy use in Gaza. In October, the US released its own missiles for the Iron Dome air defence system to Israel. Israel’s response to initial heavy Hamas rocket attacks and attacks from Hezbollah and the Houthis had depleted Israel’s stocks to such an alarming level that it requested all of the Tamir interceptor missiles that the US had bought and kept in Israel until deployment. The Israeli forces would also welcome a break in fighting to evaluate its tactics so far in light of its performance against Hamas tunnels. As many analysts have warned — me included — despite dogs, robots, ground-penetrating radars, and other technology, thetunnelscan be destroyed only once soldiers get inside. That is a bloody task, as was proven last week when four commandos were killed by an improvised explosive device after opening a tunnel cover. A few days ago, an unidentified Israeli officer briefing reporters embedded with the Israeli forces admitted, “We don’t want to go down there. We know that they left us a lot of side bombs.” London-based weekly The Jewish Chronicle reported on November 16 that standing orders were clear: “No one is allowed togo into a tunnel.” The Israeli forces must also look into the effectiveness of their allegedly sophisticated and specialised training in simulators of Gaza City. Some of the simulation assumptions based on 2009 and 2014 incursions into Gaza have proven not applicable in 2023. It will also have to analyse why so manyMerkava tanks, believed almost invincible, were incapacitated. Reliable reports indicate up to 30 have been destroyed or are too damaged to use. While the military would welcome three or five days of respite — but would likely not admit it — politicians would clearly see it as their loss. Netanyahu and his hawks have been staunchly against any pause so if they accept it now, the public will see it as their weakness, no matter how they try to justify bowing to international pressure. The fact that US President Joe Biden, notionally Israel’s closest ally, has put his weight behind securing a break must be rubbing salt into the Israeli PM’s wounds. If the agreed period without fighting is observed, which is always a big risk, Israeli politicians will face new pressure at its end; the world might ask, “If it was a success, why don’t you just extend it?” Netanyahu’s greatest nightmare would be to get to a point where he not only failed to destroy Hamas but de facto recognised it by negotiating, even if indirectly. Deprived of Gaza, fuming Israelis would certainly go for his political skin instead.

The US Air Force flew almost 1,000 tonnes of weapons and ammunition to Israel per day, for a total of more than 22,000 tonnes. That isbeing repeated now, albeit on a smaller scale. For the past two weeks, US C-17 transports have been landing regularly at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv and at Nevatim airbase in the Negev desert. Most aircraft fly in from the Ramstein airbase in Germany, where the US has warehouses full of “prepositioned stock” — equipment set aside for military emergencies. There is little doubt that heavier and less urgent supplies are beingshipped to Israel by sea. Among them will surely be replenishment rockets for the tracked version of the high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), the M270 multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) that saw heavy use in Gaza. In October, the US released its own missiles for the Iron Dome air defence system to Israel. Israel’s response to initial heavy Hamas rocket attacks and attacks from Hezbollah and the Houthis had depleted Israel’s stocks to such an alarming level that it requested all of the Tamir interceptor missiles that the US had bought and kept in Israel until deployment. The Israeli forces would also welcome a break in fighting to evaluate its tactics so far in light of its performance against Hamas tunnels. As many analysts have warned — me included — despite dogs, robots, ground-penetrating radars, and other technology, thetunnelscan be destroyed only once soldiers get inside. That is a bloody task, as was proven last week when four commandos were killed by an improvised explosive device after opening a tunnel cover. A few days ago, an unidentified Israeli officer briefing reporters embedded with the Israeli forces admitted, “We don’t want to go down there. We know that they left us a lot of side bombs.” London-based weekly The Jewish Chronicle reported on November 16 that standing orders were clear: “No one is allowed togo into a tunnel.” The Israeli forces must also look into the effectiveness of their allegedly sophisticated and specialised training in simulators of Gaza City. Some of the simulation assumptions based on 2009 and 2014 incursions into Gaza have proven not applicable in 2023. It will also have to analyse why so manyMerkava tanks, believed almost invincible, were incapacitated. Reliable reports indicate up to 30 have been destroyed or are too damaged to use. While the military would welcome three or five days of respite — but would likely not admit it — politicians would clearly see it as their loss. Netanyahu and his hawks have been staunchly against any pause so if they accept it now, the public will see it as their weakness, no matter how they try to justify bowing to international pressure. The fact that US President Joe Biden, notionally Israel’s closest ally, has put his weight behind securing a break must be rubbing salt into the Israeli PM’s wounds. If the agreed period without fighting is observed, which is always a big risk, Israeli politicians will face new pressure at its end; the world might ask, “If it was a success, why don’t you just extend it?” Netanyahu’s greatest nightmare would be to get to a point where he not only failed to destroy Hamas but de facto recognised it by negotiating, even if indirectly. Deprived of Gaza, fuming Israelis would certainly go for his political skin instead.

What is next for some of these stocks because this is a wave which, in a sense, has changed for them? Yes, what is next is there is no reason for us to assume that they will not continue on the value creation journey. I think these are great companies and Tata Group per se enjoys very high reputation and loyalty amongst the investors, domestic as well as global. Any business, if it is a Tata group company, always trades at a premium compared to another company in the similar industry. They have strengths which they have gained over a long period of time, which will sustain them going ahead as well.  Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO Courses Offering College Course Website IIM Lucknow IIML Chief Operations Officer Programme Visit IIM Lucknow IIML Chief Marketing Officer Programme Visit Indian School of Business ISB Chief Technology Officer Visit Now that we are seeing that the US markets have stabilized and the debt markets over there have also stabilized and inflation seems to be coming under control, one could expect better prospects for all these technology companies –  Tata Technologies , Tata Elxsi, TCS. Companies like Trent and Titan have been outliers. Other companies per se have done badly in the same group, but they continue to thrive pretty well. But would you say the same for  Tata Tech  as well? Yes, absolutely. I think it is a no-brainer. You have to apply for the Tata Tech IPO and maybe you could even consider buying it on listing. It will always trade at a premium multiple. And what I like best about the company, the last three, four quarters, when a lot of the software companies were under stress, this is one company which continued to deliver very decent numbers as well. And the track record is quite phenomenal. And most importantly, if you look at the entire spectrum of software companies, the companies which are engaged in the automobile vertical, there is the least amount of cut in tech spending over there. So in Tata Elxsi, KPIT, Cummins, Tata Technologies, considering the kind of disruption taking place, one can expect very good order flow going ahead as well. You Might Also Like: Should you buy Tata Tech in case of a gap-up listing? SAMCO Securities explains Tata Tech IPO price is around Rs 500, the grey market premium is suggesting at least Rs 300-350. You are saying even if it lists at around Rs 800-850, one should go ahead and buy? I would think so. And my advice would be that if you already have an allotment, then you could average at listing price. But let us see what the listing price does take place. And one could look at a few weeks after that, once the euphoria has settled down, where the stock price trades at. But I think that even if you add Rs 300 more to it, then also the price earnings multiple would be in line with some of the other peer group company – be it Tata Elxsi or KPIT. These two companies, the listed peer group, are trading at a reasonable premium to the rest of the software companies purely on account of superior financials. So I think Tata Technologies also will trade at those rich price earnings multiples. Incrementally in this market, now that there is state election and followed by central election, today we are just considering the impact of that and soon we will start talking about the impact of the election cycle. What would a portfolio manager like you be doing? Would you be raising cash, would you be buying puts or would you do nothing?  See, I normally do not like to buy puts per se or trade in the derivatives market. And we are typically long-term investors. So from that point of view, I think any time there is an opportunity for a good quality listing or a good quality stock that is when you should attempt to get into a company and have a longer term horizon. The key underperformers continue to be from the banking sector and the PSU Bank specifically. What should one do to their bank holdings at the moment? Should one book their profits/losses, sit on them or just add positions, average out? Banks are going to be a great investment as well. The only problem with the banking sector is over-ownership because these stocks are so many in number, a lot of the weightages in the individual portfolios is very high. And therefore, we are seeing this underperformance coming in.  You Might Also Like: We are driving disruption and change  in auto ER&D  space; have home advantage against GCCs: Tata Tech CEO Investors are chasing some other investment themes because they already have too many banks in their portfolio. That is my assessment. But by and large, these are great secular stories. I do not see any visible signs of the NPA cycle turning bad for the banking industry per se. The credit demand remains pretty strong.  Real estate is a sector which takes a lot of credit demand. Automobiles are doing well. Capex cycle has picked up. Working capital cycles have improved. So there is a great demand for credit. And broadly, interest rate, inflation all those risk factors have been contained. And in fact, we could expect a long period of stable interest rates followed by a declining interest rate scenario, which is very positive for banks.  So in my view, from a fundamental basis, banks certainly should do very well. I understand that they have underperformed. That is more due to technical factors and more due to liquidity reasons than actual fundamentals. Look at the communication from RBI. Go easy on unsecured loans. It has been a mainstay of growth for them. Since the interest rate cycle has picked up, the NIM expansion will not be there. There really has to be some new buyer who has to come in for banks to go higher because everybody is drowning in banks now. It is a struggle to find a bear on HDFC Bank. Don’t you think the best of the earnings is behind us? No, I do not think so. I agree that there is an ownership factor. Everybody has got them in their portfolios. And there are hardly any bears in the banking sector. But these things take time. They play out themselves. I mean, who knows if you have a very strong FII number coming through the next two to three quarters or so and that is easily possible because with interest rates settling down abroad, you could have a risk on trade.  You Might Also Like: Should you go for Tata Tech IPO now or buy 6-12 months down the line after volatility subsides? Dipan Mehta answers If the currency starts to strengthen, you could see foreign inflows. And the first sector that foreign money will come into will be the banks, especially large cap private sector banks. So just because the stock is over-owned, just because its PE-multiple is gradually compressing or because foreigners are not buying, these are not reasons to sell a good quality company.  Companies like HDFC, Kotak, Mahindra Bank, ICICI are still growing in terms of their earnings. And even if the stock price is going nowhere for maybe even one more year or two more years, you will find that they are trading at very attractive price-to-earnings, price-to-book multiples. I know one thing watching the market, that if a stock is really cheap and attractive, somebody will come and buy it. It does not matter what the technical factors are. It does not matter what the liquidity conditions are. So I am very positive on banks per se.  If an investor has an under-allocation to banks in their portfolio, this is a great time to add banking stocks to your list of holdings as well. And most importantly, I cannot mention the importance of this credit growth which is taking place. In India also, when you look at the banks and NBFCs, the net interest margin still remains quite healthy. Of course, there is going to be some pressure but it is not that it is going to collapse.

Each nose has around 400 scent receptors that are said to be able to detect around one trillion different odours. To replicate such a level of sensory expertise in scientific equipment is a daunting challenge. Yet thanks to recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), the latest electronic noses - high-tech sensors that can detect and report specific smells - are quickly improving their levels of speed and accuracy. Their proponents say that they can transform food safety. Common types of potentially deadly foodborne bacteria are salmonella and E. Coli. Both of these have their own ""electronic personality"", says Prof Raz Jelinek, the co-developer of an e-nose called Sensifi, and a professor of chemistry at Ben Gurion University of the Negev, in Israel. ""They have their own electrical signal."" The e-noses made by the Israeli company of the same name contain electrodes that are coated with nanoparticles of carbon. They detect the smells or volatile organic compounds (VOC) given off by bacteria. Different strains of bacteria produce a different VOC fingerprint, which in turn creates a different electric signal in the Sensifi machine. This is then recorded by an AI software system, which checks it against its ever-growing database, and notifies the user. Sensifi, which launched earlier this year, hopes that it can transform the fight against infection in the food industry. Its chief executive Modi Peled says that in most cases food producers currently have to send samples off to a laboratory for testing, and then wait a number of days for the results to come back.  By contrast, Sensifi's e-noses can be used on site by the food firms themselves, and are said to give their results in less than one hour. It hasn't released a price for its machines, but says they will be ""low cost"". The firm instead intends to make most of its money from subscription fees. ""Testing methods in the food industry have remained the same for 40 to 50 years,"" says Mr Peled. ""Until now AI hadn't really entered the testing segment of this market."" Read additional stories on artificial intelligence Food poisoning remains a serious problem around the world. In the US, 48 million people, or one in six, get sick every year from a foodborne illness. Of these, 128,000 are hospitalised, and 3,000 people die. In the UK, it is calculated that there are 2.4 million cases of food poisoning every year, and an estimated 180 deaths. ""People would say that meat, poultry and fish are the main culprits,"" says Mr Peled. ""But if you look at the biggest killer in the US food industry in the last five to 10 years, it is the romaine lettuce. ""And the more the food market is being industrialised, the more it will be susceptible to pathogens."" At German firm NTT Data Business Solutions it had a novel way to help train the AI that powers the e-nose it is developing - coffee. In one test, technicians spent three days putting instant coffee powder next to the AI's sensors. The AI then had to identify one of three options - good coffee, bad coffee (coffee that had been laced with vinegar), and no coffee at all. ""An odour isn't just a gas, it is a unique combination of gases,"" says Adrian Kostrz, the firm's innovation manager. ""And very often there are variations or very small differences in the way things smell."" NTT's sensors are fitted to a 3D-printed plastic model of a human nose. It is training its AI with coffee and other foodstuffs to enable it to know what they are meant to smell like when they are fresh and in good condition, which the firm says is ""the reference value of an odour"". The idea is that NTT's e-nose can be used not just to sniff out any contagions, but also how fresh - or not - a foodstuff is. This will help enable supermarkets or cafes to know what to sell first when something doesn't come with best-before dates. ""Knowing the reference value of an odour would help the food industry to adapt its production, storage, harvesting and processes accordingly,"" adds Mr Kostrz. However, some AI experts say that while the latest e-noses work well, they are unlikely to see significant demand, because food firms are likely to be put off by the cost. ""If you're talking about deploying a worldwide network of small detectors, from the picking to storage, to delivery, you have to consider how that's going to impact the business model,"" says Vincent Peters, founder and chief designer of US-based AI research firm Inheritance AI. ""Will there still be a business if you have to deploy and sustain that technology? Will the supply chain management actually implement it? Will there be a profit margin?"" Meanwhile, fellow AI expert, Kjell Carlsson of San Francisco-based Domino Data Lab, says that the e-noses would need complicated fine tuning for each facility they were working at. ""This is an extraordinarily difficult task in an industry not known for embracing new technologies,"" he says. However, such scepticism is not discouraging some entrepreneurs. In New Zealand, a company called Scentian Bio, says it has copied the antennae of insects to develop its ""biosensors"". This has seen it replicate insect proteins, and include them in its scent sensors. Andrew Kralicek, founder and chief technology officer of the firm, says that as a result of this biotechnology its sensors are ""thousands of times more sensitive than a dog's nose"". He adds: ""We can use this biosensor-based tech virtually everywhere - in food and flavour quality control, food pathogen detection, non-invasive rapid disease diagnosis, sustainable farming, and environmental and wellness monitoring.""","The human nose and its ability to smell is an amazing thing.

Yet thanks to recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), the latest electronic noses - high-tech sensors that can detect and report specific smells - are quickly improving their levels of speed and accuracy. Their proponents say that they can transform food safety. Common types of potentially deadly foodborne bacteria are salmonella and E. Coli. Both of these have their own ""electronic personality"", says Prof Raz Jelinek, the co-developer of an e-nose called Sensifi, and a professor of chemistry at Ben Gurion University of the Negev, in Israel. ""They have their own electrical signal."" The e-noses made by the Israeli company of the same name contain electrodes that are coated with nanoparticles of carbon. They detect the smells or volatile organic compounds (VOC) given off by bacteria. Different strains of bacteria produce a different VOC fingerprint, which in turn creates a different electric signal in the Sensifi machine. This is then recorded by an AI software system, which checks it against its ever-growing database, and notifies the user. Sensifi, which launched earlier this year, hopes that it can transform the fight against infection in the food industry. Its chief executive Modi Peled says that in most cases food producers currently have to send samples off to a laboratory for testing, and then wait a number of days for the results to come back.  By contrast, Sensifi's e-noses can be used on site by the food firms themselves, and are said to give their results in less than one hour. It hasn't released a price for its machines, but says they will be ""low cost"". The firm instead intends to make most of its money from subscription fees. ""Testing methods in the food industry have remained the same for 40 to 50 years,"" says Mr Peled. ""Until now AI hadn't really entered the testing segment of this market."" Read additional stories on artificial intelligence Food poisoning remains a serious problem around the world. In the US, 48 million people, or one in six, get sick every year from a foodborne illness. Of these, 128,000 are hospitalised, and 3,000 people die. In the UK, it is calculated that there are 2.4 million cases of food poisoning every year, and an estimated 180 deaths. ""People would say that meat, poultry and fish are the main culprits,"" says Mr Peled. ""But if you look at the biggest killer in the US food industry in the last five to 10 years, it is the romaine lettuce. ""And the more the food market is being industrialised, the more it will be susceptible to pathogens."" At German firm NTT Data Business Solutions it had a novel way to help train the AI that powers the e-nose it is developing - coffee. In one test, technicians spent three days putting instant coffee powder next to the AI's sensors. The AI then had to identify one of three options - good coffee, bad coffee (coffee that had been laced with vinegar), and no coffee at all. ""An odour isn't just a gas, it is a unique combination of gases,"" says Adrian Kostrz, the firm's innovation manager. ""And very often there are variations or very small differences in the way things smell."" NTT's sensors are fitted to a 3D-printed plastic model of a human nose. It is training its AI with coffee and other foodstuffs to enable it to know what they are meant to smell like when they are fresh and in good condition, which the firm says is ""the reference value of an odour"". The idea is that NTT's e-nose can be used not just to sniff out any contagions, but also how fresh - or not - a foodstuff is. This will help enable supermarkets or cafes to know what to sell first when something doesn't come with best-before dates. ""Knowing the reference value of an odour would help the food industry to adapt its production, storage, harvesting and processes accordingly,"" adds Mr Kostrz. However, some AI experts say that while the latest e-noses work well, they are unlikely to see significant demand, because food firms are likely to be put off by the cost. ""If you're talking about deploying a worldwide network of small detectors, from the picking to storage, to delivery, you have to consider how that's going to impact the business model,"" says Vincent Peters, founder and chief designer of US-based AI research firm Inheritance AI. ""Will there still be a business if you have to deploy and sustain that technology? Will the supply chain management actually implement it? Will there be a profit margin?"" Meanwhile, fellow AI expert, Kjell Carlsson of San Francisco-based Domino Data Lab, says that the e-noses would need complicated fine tuning for each facility they were working at. ""This is an extraordinarily difficult task in an industry not known for embracing new technologies,"" he says. However, such scepticism is not discouraging some entrepreneurs. In New Zealand, a company called Scentian Bio, says it has copied the antennae of insects to develop its ""biosensors"". This has seen it replicate insect proteins, and include them in its scent sensors. Andrew Kralicek, founder and chief technology officer of the firm, says that as a result of this biotechnology its sensors are ""thousands of times more sensitive than a dog's nose"". He adds: ""We can use this biosensor-based tech virtually everywhere - in food and flavour quality control, food pathogen detection, non-invasive rapid disease diagnosis, sustainable farming, and environmental and wellness monitoring.""",955,"[""Sensifi"", ""Modi Peled"", ""NTT Data Business Solutions"", ""Adrian Kostrz"", ""Vincent Peters"", ""Kjell Carlsson"", ""Scentian Bio""]","[""Sensifi"", ""Modi Peled"", ""Scentian Bio"", ""Adrian Kostrz""]",1O_uGBk4yKRIf_SNFYPnRwGtavWKcUh0S

In the latest episode of The Simpsons the hapless dad turns his son Bart, and then himself, into NFTs to make millions. It all goes wrong when Homer finds out from a floating pizza cat that ""the NFT craze is over"". The episode has been widely applauded by NFT fans and sceptics alike for successfully poking fun at a side of the crypto world that exploded a couple of years ago but has now gone very quiet. So is the floating pizza cat right, and are NFTs really dead? Well analysis shows the once frenzied Non Fungible Token market declined to its lowest level recently, with October being dubbed ""Floptober"". But some think there's hope. NFTs are digital tokens of ownership usually bought with cryptocurrency. They're often linked to images or videos, but owning an NFT does not normally mean the buyer gets the copyright of the picture. Anyone can view it online and even copy and save it, but only the buyer has the status of being the official owner of its token. Proof is etched onto the uneditable record of the blockchain - a giant spreadsheet of transactions published online. According to researchers at Dapp Radar, the value of NFT transactions just hit the lowest point since the NFT market peaked.   Trading volume - the amount of money in sales across the whole industry - has fallen 89% from the beginning of 2022 to now.  Back then in the first quarter of 2022 it was $12.6bn (£10.4bn), and now in the third quarter of 2023 it's a mere $1.39bn. And the industry is contracting. Last month Yuga Labs - the creators of the talismanic Bored Ape NFTs - announced an unspecified number of redundancies.  Bored Ape Yacht Club is one of its most famous series. It once had NFTs selling for millions of dollars, fuelled by celebrity buyers including talk show host Jimmy Fallon and media personality Paris Hilton.  Paris Hilton has not posted on X, formerly Twitter, about NFTs since October 2022, in spite of almost daily tweets in January and February 2022 to promote her collections. According to the NFT Price Floor website, the floor price of Bored Ape NFTs (the value of the cheapest in the collection) peaked at the beginning of May 2022, then costing around $268,000 (144 Ethereum coins). Now it's dropped to $56,000.  Collector and artist Taylor Whitley from the US felt forced to sell six of his seven prized Bored Ape NFTs as the offers he was receiving were getting worse and worse. ""I haven't really wanted to sell, but the market is really bad, so it's the smart thing for me to do. I think the NFT market could even go lower,"" he tells the BBC. Last month, Taylor sold his most valuable Bored Ape for $212,000 after previously turning down much better offers for it.  He could have got at least 10 times more for his NFTs if he'd have sold at the peak. It has stung him, but as an early investor he's still made incredible profits. His most recent sale is a 1,000 times return on his initial $200 investment. For every Bored Ape NFT there are millions of other smaller brands and artists making up the industry.  Angie Taylor from Scotland was selling her NFT artwork for as much as $8,000 an item, but now she gets around $600.  She's had to go back to her pre-NFT job as a tutor part time. ""I'm still selling bits and pieces here and there, but I am having to do a day job as well. I can't make a living off this anymore with nothing else,"" she says. But she always thought the bubble would burst.  ""I kind of budgeted for this to happen, because I thought, this is a boom and bust type of situation,"" she says. It's clearly a buyers market, and there are plenty of happy buyers out there making the most of the downturn.  Adam (known online as Little Fish) recently bagged himself a crypto punk artwork NFT for $663,000. The full-time crypto investor from Europe acknowledges that it's a large amount of money but he thinks he got a bargain with his CryptoPunk #3609. After all, a year ago its seller rejected an offer for $1.18m. ""The downturn is exactly why I bought it. People are desperate. In the winter time you can buy summer clothes for cheap,"" he says. Adam believes that summer will come again to NFTs, and he will ""enjoy it"" when it does. His analogy to seasonal changes parallels the current state of the cryptocurrency market.  Digital money like Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) have not recovered from various crashes in 2022 that saw the value of coins plummet and then stagnate in what many are calling a crypto winter. There are recent signs of a thawing, with Bitcoin rising to $34,000 a coin, but the growth has stalled, and is nowhere near the $70,000 in late 2022. Although NFTs are a different product they are built on the same blockchain technology as cryptocurrencies, and the wealth of many of the biggest NFT buyers is in lock-step with cryptocurrencies. When crypto is worth more - they have more to spend on NFTs. The biggest ever NFT investor is Vignesh Sundaresan - known as MetaKovan. His record-breaking $69m purchase of an NFT by American artist Beeple was one of the big catalysts that sent the market soaring in March 2021. ""It's still a long way to go before we can look back and see whether, you know, it was a good purchase or not,"" says Mr Sundaresan. ""It was definitely a lot of money, but it wasn't a significant amount of my wealth."" More technology of business Mr Sundaresan still believes that NFTs have a bright future as art collectibles, but he thinks the boom days are over. ""Everything in crypto happens very fast, and I think the next phase of NFTs won't be about the price. People who are speculating are taking a huge risk because it's not even like the supply is finite,"" he says. Vignesh is critical of the industry that capitalised on the speculative craze and has left many people out of pocket.  ""I've not seen any good sustainable businesses around NFTs,"" he says. One NFT business that appears to be bucking the trend though is Pudgy Penguins - a brand that recently started selling soft toys based on its NFT characters. Each toy sold provides royalties to the corresponding Pudgy Penguin NFT holder. Allowing NFT owners to make money through intellectual property appears to be a trend that is potentially reviving interest in the products. Pudgy Penguins have maintained a floor price similar to its peak in January 2023, according to the NFT Floor Price website. Other new ways buyers are being offered increased incentives are through membership to exclusive events, physical versions of NFTs and scrapping of artist royalties. British NFT entrepreneur known as Pranksy thinks experimenting is key to a market recovery.

The US Central Command (Centcom), which oversees operations in the Middle East, says the rounds were confiscated from a ship bound for Yemen in December. Ukraine's Western allies recently warned that their production lines were struggling to keep up with the rate at which Ukraine was using ammunition. Centcom says the Iranian rounds were transferred to Ukraine on Monday. It added the ammunition was 7.62mm calibre used in Soviet-era rifles and light machine-guns. While the number is significant, it represents a small percentage of the hundreds of millions of rounds already shipped by allies to Ukraine.  The US has already provided more than 200 million bullets and grenades. The Iranian munitions were originally seized by US naval forces from a stateless ship named MARWAN 1 on 9 December, it said. The US government gained ownership of them in July through a process known as civil forfeiture, by which an asset can be seized if its owner is thought to be involved in criminal activity.  In this case, the claim was brought against Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a branch of the Iranian armed forces tasked with preserving the country's government. In a statement, Centcom said the US was ""committed to working with our allies and partners to counter the flow of Iranian lethal aid in the region by all lawful means"". Iran backs the Houthi rebels in Yemen's ongoing civil war, but arms transfers to the group are barred under a 2015 resolution by the UN Security Council. The civil war in Yemen began in 2014 when the Houthis took control of the capital Sanaa and removed the country's government.  The ousted government remains the internationally recognised authority in Yemen and is backed by a Saudi-led coalition of countries in the region as well as the US and the UK.  Since the second half of last year, Iran has also repeatedly been accused of supplying Russia with arms, most notably drones, for use in the war in Ukraine.  Oleksandr Vasiuk, a Ukrainian MP who co-chairs a committee on cooperation with the US, said the transfer ""proves once again that the US is our strong ally"". ""These seized weapons and ammunition could have been simply disposed of, but Washington understands how important it is for us to get help,"" he said. After the recent political turbulence in the US, which is now directly affecting military aid for Ukraine, Kyiv is keen to celebrate any support package it receives.  While 1.1 million bullets are likely to be less pivotal than tanks or long-range missiles, every single one will be welcomed during a war of attrition. For Ukraine, there is also a slight poetry in its soldiers firing Iranian bullets at a force that uses dozens of Iranian-made drones. The transfer comes amid rising concern among Western allies over their continued ability to arm Kyiv. On Monday at the Warsaw Security Forum, Adm Rob Bauer, the chairman of Nato's military committee, said that the ""bottom of the barrel is now visible"". He said decades of underinvestment meant that, even at the start of the war, Nato countries' ammunition stocks had been half-full or even emptier. He added that governments and arms manufacturers needed to ""ramp up production in a much higher tempo"". ""The just-in-time, just-enough economy we built together in 30 years in our liberal economies is fine for a lot of things - but not the armed forces when there is a war ongoing,"" he said. UK Defence Minister James Heappey urged Nato allies to spend 2% of their national income on defence, a target agreed by the whole bloc but expected to be met this year by only 11 of its 31 members. The transfer of the Iranian ammunition also comes as the Biden administration looks for alternative ways to provide assistance to Ukraine amid opposition from some in Congress. Officials have been warning for weeks that the money currently allocated to Ukraine has been nearly exhausted, but pressure from members of the Republican right has so far prevented the House of Representatives from approving additional funds. On Tuesday, some of the same members won a vote to unseat House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a move which will delay any vote on further aid until after a replacement is installed, which will not happen until at least the middle of next week.  Even then, any future Speaker who brings a vote on the issue to the floor is almost certain to face similar opposition. ","The US has sent roughly 1.1 million bullets seized from Iran last year to Ukraine, its military has said. The US Central Command (Centcom), which oversees operations in the Middle East, says the rounds were confiscated from a ship bound for Yemen in December. Ukraine's Western allies recently warned that their production lines were struggling to keep up with the rate at which Ukraine was using ammunition. Centcom says the Iranian rounds were transferred to Ukraine on Monday. It added the ammunition was 7.62mm calibre used in Soviet-era rifles and light machine-guns. While the number is significant, it represents a small percentage of the hundreds of millions of rounds already shipped by allies to Ukraine.  The US has already provided more than 200 million bullets and grenades. The Iranian munitions were originally seized by US naval forces from a stateless ship named MARWAN 1 on 9 December, it said. The US government gained ownership of them in July through a process known as civil forfeiture, by which an asset can be seized if its owner is thought to be involved in criminal activity.

Russia is reported to be preparing to introduce laws that would require foreign visitors to sign a “loyalty agreement”. The interior ministry is preparing the legislation that would bar visitors from criticising Russian policy or discrediting Soviet history. It would also require that they respect traditional Russian family values, culture and environment, state news agency TASS reported on Wednesday. All foreigners would have to sign the pledge, which would, in effect, control what they can say and do while in Russia. This means visitors would be prohibited from “interfering with the activities of public authorities of the Russian Federation, discrediting in any form the foreign and domestic state policy of the Russian Federation, public authorities and their officials,” the report said. For the draft to become law, the document has to be introduced to the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, and to go through committee review and several readings before being submitted to President Vladimir Putin for signing. Officials told state news agency Interfax that the legislation is being worked on by the interior ministry, the government, and the presidential administration and is well advanced. Lieutenant General Valentina Kazakova, head of the ministry’s Main Directorate for Migration, told TASS, “The bill is currently under discussion and will be submitted to the State Duma shortly.” In particular, foreigners would be barred from “distorting the historical truth about the feat of the Soviet people in the defence of the Fatherland and its contribution to the victory over fascism,” the draft bill reads, according to TASS.

Evencritics and scholarswithin Russia, who document his totalitarian regime’s atrocities, have lost access to Kremlin-controlled media and are branded “foreign agents”. As the 2024 presidential election approaches, Putin has cast the war as part of an existential battle with the West, saying he will defend Russia’s “sacred” civilisation from what he portrays as the West’s decadence. Under the law, foreigners would have to uphold and abide by “traditional family values”, the “institution of marriage” and “traditional sexual relations”, according to TASS. Russia under President Putin has touted itself as a country home to more conservative moral and family values, backed by theRussian Orthodox Church. To this end, the authorities have cracked down on the LGBTQ community, passing legislationoutlawinggender-affirming surgeries and banning “gay propaganda”. Lawmakers, in recent months have also been working on legislation to limit access to reproductive careand abortions as a way of improving the “demographic situation” and countering the low birth rate. “The legislative initiative proposes prohibiting activities that encourage a neglectful attitude toward Russia’s environment or natural resources … Russia’s regional and ethno-cultural diversity [and] traditional Russian moral and spiritual values,” reported TASS.

United States appeals court judges have signalled scepticism towards Donald Trump’s bid to overturn agag orderimposed on the former president in a federal criminal case in which he is accused of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat. It forbids Trump from publicly maligning any prosecutors, potential witnesses or court employees involved in the case. Trump lawyer D John Sauer argued on Monday that the order violates the US Constitution’s First Amendment right to freedom of speech while judges on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia asked whether Trump’s charged rhetoric would threaten the integrity of his upcoming trial. “I don’t hear you giving any weight at all to the interests in a fair trial,” Judge Cornelia Pillard told Sauer. Pillard is one of three judges who heard Trump’s appeal of the gag order imposed by US District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing the case. Chutkan ruled that public statements by Trump or his lawyers criticising prosecutors, court staff and potential witnesses could influence witnesses and lead to threats against people involved in the case. But Chutkan permitted Trump to “criticize the Justice Department, President Biden and herself. She also allowed him to maintain that the prosecution itself was a partisan retaliation against him,” The New York Times reported. “The order is unprecedented, and it sets a terrible precedent on future restrictions on core political speech,” Sauer said during the two-hour hearing. Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic President Joe Biden in the 2024 election, has assailed officials involved in a range of criminal and civil cases he faces. He has called US Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought the federal election-related charges, a “deranged lunatic” and a “thug”. Trump’s remarks about prosecutors and witnesses have pit his right to freedom of speech against the need for a fair trial next year. The gag order has been suspended during Trump’s appeal.Trump has pleaded not guiltyin the case as well as all three other criminal cases. The judges asked Department of Justice lawyer Cecil VanDevender whether the order was written too broadly. “We have to use a careful scalpel here,” said Judge Patricia Millett, a Democratic judicial appointee like the other two on the panel. VanDevender said the order still allows Trump to make broad arguments about the integrity of the case. “He can say, ‘This is a politically motivated prosecution brought by my political opponent,’ ‘The Department of Justice is corrupt,’ and ‘I will be vindicated at trial,’ – all of that stuff,” VanDevender said.

The potential disclosure was reported to special counsel Jack Smith's team as they investigated Trump's allegedhoarding of classified documentsat Mar-a-Lago, the sources told ABC News. The information could shed further light on Trump's handling of sensitive government secrets. Prosecutors and FBI agents have at least twice this year interviewed the Mar-a-Lago member, Anthony Pratt, who runs U.S.-based Pratt Industries, one of the world's largest packaging companies.  In those interviews, Pratt described how -- looking to make conversation with Trump during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago in April 2021 -- he brought up the American submarine fleet, which the two had discussed before, the sources told ABC News. According to Pratt's account, as described by the sources, Pratt told Trump he believed Australia should start buying its submarines from the United States, to which an excited Trump -- ""leaning"" toward Pratt as if to be discreet -- then told Pratt two pieces of information about U.S. submarines: the supposed exact number of nuclear warheads they routinely carry, and exactly how close they supposedly can get to a Russian submarine without being detected. In emails and conversations after meeting with Trump, Pratt described Trump's remarks to at least 45 others, including six journalists, 11 of his company's employees, 10 Australian officials, and three former Australian prime ministers, the sources told ABC News. While Pratt told investigators he couldn’t tell if what Trump said about U.S. submarines was real or just bluster, investigators nevertheless asked Pratt not to repeat the numbers that Trump allegedly told him, suggesting the information could be too sensitive to relay further, ABC News was told. It's unclear if the information was accurate, but the episode was investigated by Smith's team. Sources said another witness, one of Trump's former employees at Mar-a-Lago, told investigators that, within minutes of Pratt's meeting with Trump, he heard Pratt relaying to someone else some of what Trump had just said. According to the sources, the former Mar-a-Lago employee also told investigators he was ""bothered"" and ""shocked"" to hear that the former president had provided such seemingly sensitive information to a non-U.S. citizen. Pratt told investigators Trump didn't show him any government documents during their April 2021 meeting, nor at any other time they crossed paths at Mar-a-Lago, sources said. According to the sources, Pratt insisted to investigators that he told others about his meeting with Trump to show them how he was advocating for Australia with the United States. Some of the Australian officials that sources said he told were, as reflected in news reports at the time, involved in then-ongoing negotiations with the Biden administration over a deal for Australia to purchase a number of nuclear-powered attack submarines from the United States. The deal was ultimately secured earlier this year, with Australia agreeing to purchase at least three Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines, though President Joe Biden has said that none of the submarines sold to Australia will be armed with nuclear weapons.  Special counsel Smith did not include any information about Trump's alleged April 2021 conversation with Pratt in hisJune indictment against Trump, which charged the former president with 40 counts of unlawful retention of national defense information and obstruction-related offenses. Last year, while needling the Biden administration for what he said was a weak response to Russia's war on Ukraine, Trump said that if he were still president, he would make sure Russia understood that the United States is ""a greater nuclear power"" with ""the greatest submarines in the world."" ""[They are] the most powerful machines ever built, and nobody knows where they are,"" Trump said on the Fox Business network. Shortly after Trump became president in 2017, Pratt joined Mar-a-Lago as a member and publicly pledged to invest another $2 billion in American manufacturing jobs. Over the next few years, Pratt visited Mar-a-Lago about 10 times, interacting with Trump on several occasions, once even having dinner with Trump and a U.S. senator at another Trump-owned property nearby, Pratt told investigators, according to sources. Pratt also visited the White House in 2018, when Trump was meeting with Australia's then-prime minister, according to online records.  In 2019, speaking at the opening of a Pratt Industries plant in Wapakoneta, Ohio, Trump called Pratt a ""friend"" and praised him for funding the plant. ""We're here to celebrate a great opening and a great gentleman,"" Trump said. ""Anthony is one of the most successful men in the world -- perhaps Australia's most successful man."" Standing beside Trump, Pratt then said he ""would not have invested in this plant if it wasn't for President Trump's election, [which] has given us an incredible faith in investing in America."" But in recent months, according to sources, Pratt told investigators that he now supports the current U.S. government, describing himself as someone who tends to just ""side with the king."" Representatives for Pratt did not respond to messages seeking comment from ABC News.

Abu Dhabi became the most prominent Arab nation to establish diplomatic ties with Israel in 30 years under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020.That paved the way for other Arab states to forge their own ties with Israel by breaking a taboo on normalising relations without the creation of a Palestinian state. The mounting death toll from Israel's invasion of the Gaza Strip - launched in retaliation for cross-border attacks on Oct. 7 by the Hamas militant group that governs the enclave - have stirred outrage in Arab capitals. UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke last month with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. UAE officials have publicly condemned Israel's actions and repeatedly called for an end to the violence. In response to a request for comment for this story, an Emirati official said the UAE's immediate priority was to secure a ceasefire and to open up humanitarian corridors. The Gulf Arab power, backed by its oil wealth, wields significant influence in regional affairs. It also serves as a security partner of the United States, hosting American forces.  As well as speaking to Israel, the UAE has worked to moderate public positions taken by Arab states so that once the war ends there is the possibility of a return to a broad dialogue, said the four sources, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.  Sheikh Mohamed met in Abu Dhabi on Thursday with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to discuss calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, amid Qatari-brokered talks for the release of a limited number of hostages in return for a break in the fighting. ""The UAE and Qatar stand firm in urging the need to advance de-escalation efforts and secure a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace in the region,"" Sheikh Mohamed said on social media after their discussions. Despite closer economic and security ties with Israel forged over the past three years, Abu Dhabi has had little apparent success in reining in the Gaza offensive, which has led to the death of more than 11,000 people, according to Palestinian officials. Hamas killed around 1,200 people in its surprise attack on Israel and some 240 hostages were taken, Israeli authorities have said.  Amid the impasse, the UAE has grown increasingly frustrated with its most important security partner Washington, which it believes is not exerting enough pressure to end the war, the four sources said.  Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE president, said this week that Washington needed to end the conflict swiftly and initiate a process to resolve the decades old Israeli-Palestinian issue by addressing refugees, borders and East Jerusalem.  The UAE has publicly expressed concern that the war now risks igniting regional tensions and a new wave of extremism in the Middle East. Speaking on Oct. 18 at the UN Security Council, where the UAE holds a rotating seat, ambassador Lana Nusseibeh said that Abu Dhabi had sought via the Abraham Accords with Israel and the United States to deliver prosperity and security in a new Middle East through cooperation and peaceful co-existence.  ""The indiscriminate damage visited upon the people of Gaza in pursuit of Israel's security risks extinguishing that hope,"" she said.  A senior European official told Reuters that Arab states had recognised now that it was not possible to build ties with Israel without addressing the Palestinian issue. Israel's foreign ministry declined to comment for this story.No break in ties The UAE continues to host an Israeli ambassador and there was no prospect of an end to diplomatic ties, which represented a longer-term strategic priority by Abu Dhabi, the sources said. The accord was motivated, in part, by shared concerns over the threat posed by Iran, as well as a broader economic-driven realignment of Abu Dhabi's foreign policy. The UAE sees Iran as a threat to regional security, although in recent years it has taken diplomatic steps to de-escalate tensions.  Israel and the UAE have developed close economic and security ties in the three years since normalisation, including defence cooperation. Israel supplied the UAE with air defense systems after missile and drone attacks on Abu Dhabi in early 2022 by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen. Bilateral trade has exceeded $6 billion since 2020, according to Israeli government data. Israeli tourists have thronged hotels, beaches and shopping centres in the UAE, which is an OPEC oil power and a regional business hub. ""They (UAE) have gains that they don't want to lose,"" said one of the sources, a senior diplomat based in the Middle East. Even prior to the Oct. 7 attack, however, Abu Dhabi was concerned by the failure of Israel's right-wing government to curb expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and repeated visits by right-wing religious Israelis to the compound that houses the Al Aqsa mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam. The compound, revered by Jews as a vestige of their two ancient temples, has long been a flashpoint of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  None of four sources ruled out that the UAE could downgrade or sever its ties if the crisis escalated.  Sources said that the displacement of the Palestinian population from the Gaza Strip or the West Bank into Egypt or Jordan was a red line for Abu Dhabi. James Dorsey, a senior fellow at the National University of Singapore, said the war in Gaza had discredited the notion that economic cooperation on its own could build a stable region. ""The new Middle East was being built on very fragile ground,"" he told Reuters.Distanced from Hamas Israel has rejected international calls for an immediate ceasefire: Netanyahu has said there would be no halt to its attack until hostages are returned. His government has pledged to destroy Hamas, which is classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union.  While criticising Israel's conduct of the war, Abu Dhabi has also condemned Hamas for its attack. The UAE sees the Palestinian militant group and other Islamists as a threat to the stability of the Middle East and beyond.  ""Hamas is not their favourite organisation,"" said one of the sources. ""It is Muslim Brotherhood after all.""  The UAE has led the charge against Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, the oldest Islamist organisation in the Arab World.  It helped Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi topple Mohammed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in a military takeover in 2013 that followed mass protests against his rule. The UAE provided Egypt with billions of dollars in support following Mursi's ouster.  Abu Dhabi also abandoned Sudan's former Islamist president Omar Hassan al-Bashir in 2019, ultimately leading to the fall of the Muslim Brotherhood's grip on power there after it had dominated Sudanese politics for decades. The UAE had previously pumped billions of dollars into Sudan's coffers.","ABU DHABI: The United Arab Emirates plans to maintain diplomatic ties with Israel despite international outcry over the mounting toll of the war in Gaza and hopes to have some moderating influence over the Israeli campaign while safeguarding its own interests, according to four sources familiar with UAE government policy. Abu Dhabi became the most prominent Arab nation to establish diplomatic ties with Israel in 30 years under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020.That paved the way for other Arab states to forge their own ties with Israel by breaking a taboo on normalising relations without the creation of a Palestinian state. The mounting death toll from Israel's invasion of the Gaza Strip - launched in retaliation for cross-border attacks on Oct. 7 by the Hamas militant group that governs the enclave - have stirred outrage in Arab capitals. UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke last month with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. UAE officials have publicly condemned Israel's actions and repeatedly called for an end to the violence. In response to a request for comment for this story, an Emirati official said the UAE's immediate priority was to secure a ceasefire and to open up humanitarian corridors. The Gulf Arab power, backed by its oil wealth, wields significant influence in regional affairs. It also serves as a security partner of the United States, hosting American forces.  As well as speaking to Israel, the UAE has worked to moderate public positions taken by Arab states so that once the war ends there is the possibility of a return to a broad dialogue, said the four sources, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.  Sheikh Mohamed met in Abu Dhabi on Thursday with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to discuss calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, amid Qatari-brokered talks for the release of a limited number of hostages in return for a break in the fighting. ""The UAE and Qatar stand firm in urging the need to advance de-escalation efforts and secure a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace in the region,"" Sheikh Mohamed said on social media after their discussions. Despite closer economic and security ties with Israel forged over the past three years, Abu Dhabi has had little apparent success in reining in the Gaza offensive, which has led to the death of more than 11,000 people, according to Palestinian officials. Hamas killed around 1,200 people in its surprise attack on Israel and some 240 hostages were taken, Israeli authorities have said.  Amid the impasse, the UAE has grown increasingly frustrated with its most important security partner Washington, which it believes is not exerting enough pressure to end the war, the four sources said.  Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE president, said this week that Washington needed to end the conflict swiftly and initiate a process to resolve the decades old Israeli-Palestinian issue by addressing refugees, borders and East Jerusalem.  The UAE has publicly expressed concern that the war now risks igniting regional tensions and a new wave of extremism in the Middle East. Speaking on Oct. 18 at the UN Security Council, where the UAE holds a rotating seat, ambassador Lana Nusseibeh said that Abu Dhabi had sought via the Abraham Accords with Israel and the United States to deliver prosperity and security in a new Middle East through cooperation and peaceful co-existence.  ""The indiscriminate damage visited upon the people of Gaza in pursuit of Israel's security risks extinguishing that hope,"" she said.  A senior European official told Reuters that Arab states had recognised now that it was not possible to build ties with Israel without addressing the Palestinian issue. Israel's foreign ministry declined to comment for this story.No break in ties The UAE continues to host an Israeli ambassador and there was no prospect of an end to diplomatic ties, which represented a longer-term strategic priority by Abu Dhabi, the sources said. The accord was motivated, in part, by shared concerns over the threat posed by Iran, as well as a broader economic-driven realignment of Abu Dhabi's foreign policy. The UAE sees Iran as a threat to regional security, although in recent years it has taken diplomatic steps to de-escalate tensions.  Israel and the UAE have developed close economic and security ties in the three years since normalisation, including defence cooperation. Israel supplied the UAE with air defense systems after missile and drone attacks on Abu Dhabi in early 2022 by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen. Bilateral trade has exceeded $6 billion since 2020, according to Israeli government data. Israeli tourists have thronged hotels, beaches and shopping centres in the UAE, which is an OPEC oil power and a regional business hub. ""They (UAE) have gains that they don't want to lose,"" said one of the sources, a senior diplomat based in the Middle East. Even prior to the Oct. 7 attack, however, Abu Dhabi was concerned by the failure of Israel's right-wing government to curb expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and repeated visits by right-wing religious Israelis to the compound that houses the Al Aqsa mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam. The compound, revered by Jews as a vestige of their two ancient temples, has long been a flashpoint of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  None of four sources ruled out that the UAE could downgrade or sever its ties if the crisis escalated.  Sources said that the displacement of the Palestinian population from the Gaza Strip or the West Bank into Egypt or Jordan was a red line for Abu Dhabi. James Dorsey, a senior fellow at the National University of Singapore, said the war in Gaza had discredited the notion that economic cooperation on its own could build a stable region. ""The new Middle East was being built on very fragile ground,"" he told Reuters.Distanced from Hamas Israel has rejected international calls for an immediate ceasefire: Netanyahu has said there would be no halt to its attack until hostages are returned. His government has pledged to destroy Hamas, which is classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union.  While criticising Israel's conduct of the war, Abu Dhabi has also condemned Hamas for its attack. The UAE sees the Palestinian militant group and other Islamists as a threat to the stability of the Middle East and beyond.  ""Hamas is not their favourite organisation,"" said one of the sources. ""It is Muslim Brotherhood after all.""  The UAE has led the charge against Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, the oldest Islamist organisation in the Arab World.  It helped Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi topple Mohammed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in a military takeover in 2013 that followed mass protests against his rule. The UAE provided Egypt with billions of dollars in support following Mursi's ouster.  Abu Dhabi also abandoned Sudan's former Islamist president Omar Hassan al-Bashir in 2019, ultimately leading to the fall of the Muslim Brotherhood's grip on power there after it had dominated Sudanese politics for decades.

Islamabad, Pakistan– A Pakistani court’s ruling declaring the trial of former Prime Minister Imran Khan inside a jail as illegal is being seen as a shot in the arm for the country’s main opposition leader. Khan, 71, has been languishing in jailsince August 5following his three-year conviction for unlawfully selling state gifts. Though a court granted him bail three weeks later, he remains locked up in connection with other cases. One of those cases related to Khan allegedly leaking state secrets, or the “cypher” case. But the Islamabad High Court on Tuesday said the requirements to hold the cypher trial, being held in jail for security reasons, were not being met, and hence declarednull and void. “In exceptional circumstances and where it is conducive to justice, a trial can be conducted in jail in a manner that fulfils the requirements of an open trial or a trial in camera provided it is in accordance with the procedure provided by law,” said the court. On Wednesday, Pakistan’s Supreme Court accepted a bail application from Khan but did not fix a date for a hearing. “A decision will come in the next hearing after arguments from both sides,” Khan’s lawyer Naeem Panjutha posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. Here is what you need to know about the case and what happens next: Khan, a former cricketing legend-turned-politician who heads the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, was the prime minister from 2018 to 2022 before he was removed through a no-confidence vote in parliament. After his removal, he was charged with making public the contents of a confidential cable sent by Pakistan’s former ambassador to the United States for political gains. But Khan alleges the diplomatic cable proves there was a conspiracy, allegedly hatched by the US in connivance with Pakistan’s military and political establishment, to remove him from power. The US and Pakistani authorities have repeatedly denied the charges. Khan claims thecypher case, and dozens of other charges, are a ploy by his enemies, including the powerful military, to keep him out of politics. Khan was arrested from his Lahore residence in August in the state gifts case and sentenced to three years in prison. On August 29, the Islamabad High Court suspended the sentence and ordered his release. However, immediately after the court order, a trial court directed the authorities to rearrest Khan, this time in the cypher case, and begin the trial in jail. Last month, the prosecutionindicted Khanafter holding multiple hearings and recording witness testimonies. Khan’s lawyers have rejected the charges and even raised concerns over his safety in jail. At least two assassination attempts have been made on him since he lost power in April 2022.      According to Abuzar Salman Niazi, a Lahore-based legal expert, the Islamabad High Court asked the government to provide “cogent, concrete” reasons why the trial should take place in the jail. “Once the government provides its reasonings, which should be substantial in nature, the court must allow the defendant to counter government arguments, and only then the trial court judge shall determine if the case can be held in jail or not,” Niazi told Al Jazeera. He questioned the lack of transparency in the ongoing trial and said the court insisted the hearing must be held publicly. “Even if the trial subsequently takes place in jail, it will be assumed as an open court, which means adequate access for lawyers and media observers to monitor the proceedings,” he said. Basil Nabi Malik, a Karachi-based lawyer, said the court’s order does not mean Khan is going to walk out of jail anytime soon. “In such political matters, typically, a variety of cases are lodged against an accused, inevitably resulting in such an individual remaining in jail, if not on account of one case then another. Imran Khan’s current predicament appears to be similar,” Malik told Al Jazeera. Malik said the government may consider the possibility of challenging the Islamabad High Court’s decision before the Supreme Court. “If the detailed reasons are issued soon, it is possible that the federation may consider alternate options as well,” he said. Niazi believes it is unlikely that Khan will get any immediate relief from the courts and that his imprisonment will continue. “The cypher case has been declared null and void, but till Imran Khan gets bail from the Supreme Court, it has nothing to do with his incarceration, which will continue,” he said.
