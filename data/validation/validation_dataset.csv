The result will send shockwaves through Europe, where far-right ideology is on the rise, and puts Wilders in line to lead talks to form the next governing coalition and possibly become the first far-right prime minister of the Netherlands. With nearly all votes counted, Wilders' Party for Freedom was forecast to win 37 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament, two more than predicted by an exit poll when voting finished Wednesday night and more than double the 17 he won at the last election. “I had to pinch my arm,” a jubilant Wilders said. Political parties were set to hold separate meetings Thursday to discuss the outcome before what is likely to be an arduous process of forming a new governing coalition begins Friday. Despite his harsh rhetoric, Wilders has already begun courting other right and center parties by saying in a victory speech that whatever policies he pushes will be “within the law and constitution.” Wilders’ election program included calls for a referendum on the Netherlands leaving the European Union, a total halt to accepting asylum-seekers and migrant pushbacks at Dutch borders. It also advocates the “de-Islamization” of the Netherlands. He says he wants no mosques or Islamic schools in the country, although he has been milder about Islam during this election campaign than in the past. Instead, his victory seems based on his campaign to rein-in migration -— the issue that caused the last governing coalition to quit in July —- and tackle issues such as the cost-of-living crisis and housing shortages. “Voters said, ‘We are sick of it. Sick to our stomachs,’"" he said, adding he is now on a mission to end the “asylum tsunami,” referring to the migration issue that came to dominate his campaign. “The Dutch will be No. 1 again,” Wilders said. “The people must get their nation back.” But Wilders, who has in the past been labeled a Dutch version ofDonald Trump, first must form a coalition government before he can take the reins of power. That will be tough as mainstream parties are reluctant to join forces with him and his party, but the size of his victory strengthens his hand in any negotiations. Wilders called on other parties to constructively engage in coalition talks. Pieter Omtzigt, a former centrist Christian Democrat who built his own New Social Contract party in three months to take 20 seats, said he would always be open to talks. The closest party to Wilders' in the election was an alliance of the center-left Labor Party and Green Left, which was forecast to win 25 seats. But its leader, Frans Timmermans, made clear that Wilders should not count on a coalition with him. “We will never form a coalition with parties that pretend that asylum seekers are the source of all misery,” Timmermans said, vowing to defend Dutch democracy. The historic victory came one year after the win of Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, whose Brothers of Italy’s roots were steeped in nostalgia for fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Meloni has since mellowed her stance on several issues and has become the acceptable face of the hard right in the EU. Wilders was long a firebrand lashing out at Islam, at the EU and migrants -— a stance which brought him close to power but never in it, in a nation known for compromise politics. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who boasts of turning Hungary into an “illiberal” state and has similarly harsh stances on migration and EU institutions, was quick to congratulate Wilders. “The winds of change are here! Congratulations,” Orban said. During the final weeks of his campaign, Wilders somewhat softened his stance and vowed that he would be a prime minister for all Dutch people, so much so that he gained the moniker Geert “Milders.” The election was called after the fourth and final coalition of outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte resigned in July after failing to agree to measures to rein-in migration. Rutte was replaced by Dilan Yeşilgöz-Zegerius, a former refugee from Turkey who could have become the country's first female prime minister had her party won the most votes.

Serbia will hold a snap election next month after President Aleksandar Vucic dissolved parliament in the face of political pressure at home and from the European Union. The parliamentary vote and parallel local elections will be held on December 17, less than two years after the victory of the Serbian Progressive Party at the polls. “We live in times that are difficult for the whole world, in times of global challenges, wars and conflicts when it is necessary that we are all united in preserving vital national and state interests of the Republic of Serbia,” Vucic said during an announcement on live television on Wednesday. Vucic, who is in his second term as president, faces growing criticism from the political opposition and the greater public overback-to-back shootingsin May that killed 18 people. The president and his party, which has led Serbia since 2012, have been accused by protesters of promoting a culture of violence while cracking down on media and electoral freedom. At the time of the protests, several pro-EU parties said the government had ignored protesters’ demands and called for new elections. “Serbia is in a deep political and social crisis,” they said. “The demands of those who have been protesting for months were ignored. We need responsible people in politics who will solve problems instead of ignoring them.” Vucic denies the accusations but will have to convince voters that he is serious about change. Also in need of convincing is Brussels as Serbia makes a play for EU membership. To secure entry into the 27-member bloc, it must follow the EU’s rules, which include sanctioning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, tackling organised crime and corruption, and strengthening the rule of law and human rights. While challenging, the EU’s most important precondition is that Serbia normalises itsrelationship with Kosovo, a self-proclaimed independent state since 2008 that Belgrade still regards as part of its territory. More than 100 countries recognise Kosovo as a country, but it has not yet achieved member status at the United Nations. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said on Tuesday during a visit to Belgrade that Serbia and Kosovo must make more progress if they want EU membership. Some observers believe Vucic has called for elections to delay tackling this politically sensitive problem. Much of Kosovo is ethnic Albanian, although its northern half is home to ethnic Serbians who reject the government in Pristina. The conflict between the two ethnic groups was a catalyst for violence and fighting in the late 1990s, and NATO peacekeeping troops have been stationed in Kosovo ever since.

At the time of the protests, several pro-EU parties said the government had ignored protesters’ demands and called for new elections. “Serbia is in a deep political and social crisis,” they said. “The demands of those who have been protesting for months were ignored. We need responsible people in politics who will solve problems instead of ignoring them.” Vucic denies the accusations but will have to convince voters that he is serious about change. Also in need of convincing is Brussels as Serbia makes a play for EU membership. To secure entry into the 27-member bloc, it must follow the EU’s rules, which include sanctioning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, tackling organised crime and corruption, and strengthening the rule of law and human rights. While challenging, the EU’s most important precondition is that Serbia normalises itsrelationship with Kosovo, a self-proclaimed independent state since 2008 that Belgrade still regards as part of its territory. More than 100 countries recognise Kosovo as a country, but it has not yet achieved member status at the United Nations. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said on Tuesday during a visit to Belgrade that Serbia and Kosovo must make more progress if they want EU membership. Some observers believe Vucic has called for elections to delay tackling this politically sensitive problem. Much of Kosovo is ethnic Albanian, although its northern half is home to ethnic Serbians who reject the government in Pristina. The conflict between the two ethnic groups was a catalyst for violence and fighting in the late 1990s, and NATO peacekeeping troops have been stationed in Kosovo ever since. Tensionsflaredin September following the outbreak of violence in northern Kosovo, leading Serbia to send troops to its border.

A thick layer of toxic haze has enveloped the national capital once again, forcing the two teams to cancel their training at least once as Air Quality Index ( AQI ) remains in the severe category.   While Sri Lanka decided to stay indoors on Saturday, Bangladesh braved hazardous conditions to train last evening, wearing masks at the Feroz Shah Kotla. The ' Tigers ' had cancelled their opening training session on Friday due to poor quality air.   The AQI is above 400-mark on a scale of 500 since Thursday and according to the Air Quality Early Warning System, it is likely to remain 'severe' till Tuesday.   On Sunday morning, the AQI stood at 457 according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).   The International Cricket Council (ICC) has made it clear that a call on future of the match will be taken only on game day when the match officials assess the air quality on Monday.   Article 2.8 of ICC's playing conditions, says ""If at any time the umpires together agree that the conditions of ground, weather or light, or any other circumstances are dangerous or unreasonable, they shall immediately suspend play, or not allow play to start or to recommence.""   ""The decision as to whether conditions are so bad as to warrant such action is one for the umpires alone to make, following consultation with the ICC Match Referee.""   Both the teams are no strangers to such a situation with the Sri Lankan players resorting to masks during a Test series back in 2017 and Bangladesh cricketers doing the same in a T20 in 2019.   A number of Sri Lankan players had faced respiratory issues back then, while some even vomited in the dressing room due to the hazardous conditions.   Bangladesh are already out of reckoning, while Sri Lanka's semifinal hopes are hanging by a thread, depending more on mathematics and luck than performance.   Ranked ninth out of 10 teams, Bangladesh are playing for pride, while Sri Lanka are little better placed at seventh in the standings and will look to hold on to the position to qualify for the 2025 Champions Trophy in Pakistan.   Sri Lanka have an overwhelming 42-9 record against Bangladesh in 53 ODIs but the Tigers had defeated the Islanders in the warm-up game ahead of the World Cup and will take inspiration from that win.   Sri Lanka are coming into the match after facing a nightmare against Indian pacers, who bundled them out for 55 during a 302-run thrashing and  Kusal Mendis  and his men will have to pick themselves up quickly against an equally hurt Tigers.   While injuries have been an issue, Lankan players have also faltered against high-quality opponents and Bangladesh will have to produce a superlative performance to exploit their weakness.   Sadeera Samarawickrama has been the find of the tournament for the Lankans, who have been served well by Pathum Nissanka and  skipper  Kusal Mendis in their batting from time to time though they lacked consistency.   In bowling too, Lankan pacers have blown hot and cold, while lack of key spinners have hurt the team.   For Bangladesh, it has been a forgettable outing as they have managed just one win against Afghanistan in the tournament.   A chaotic build-up and lack of form of their players have seen them succumbing to their sixth successive loss and become the first team to be eliminated from the World Cup following a defeat to Pakistan in their last game.   Their batters have not been able to build partnerships, while the bowlers too have failed to stop the run flow or take wickets, leaving even skipper Shakib Al Hasan bereft of any answers.

""Having the extra time with people was so valuable, especially waking up late Sunday and knowing they were still there.""Since the height of the pandemic, remote work has dramatically changed both offices and those who work in them. After initially being forced to work from home, many employees now enjoy all-remote or hybrid schedules. According to the Pew Research Center, one-third of U.S. workers currently have some freedom to work remotely, even if it is just one or two days a week.Wedding guests who are lucky enough to have those hybrid schedules are increasingly using them to spend a few more days wherever the celebration takes them, and hotels, wedding planners and couples are taking note and making changes.Anna Brandenberger's mother, who lives four hours away and works remotely in billing for a trading company in Chicago, came a week before the wedding.""She'd work during the day and we'd get together at night to make flower arrangements and bake together for the wedding,"" Brandenberger said. ""It was such a big stress relief to have her nearby.""Attendance may even hinge on the possibility of remote work. The Brandenbergers planned their ceremony and reception on a Friday night to save money on renting the space. That meant some guests from out of town who had to be physically at work that day and couldn't take time off weren't able to attend, Anna Brandenberger said.Some couples choose to make a weekend destination out of their ceremony. Such weddings have long been a boon to hotels and resorts, many of which also added workspaces and upgraded their Wi-Fi to cater to remote workers during the pandemic. Now the two trends are converging.At Camptown, a 50-room hotel that opened this year in Leeds, New York, at the foot of the Catskill Mountains, wedding-related stays have been getting longer, said Stephen Wendell, CEO of Mountain Shore Properties, which owns the hotel. When guests realize they can work from the lodge, which offers high-speed internet, workspaces and a pantry of snacks available to buy on the honor system, he said, ""they start thinking about relaxing and getting into wedding mode and extending their bookings.""Currently, about 20% of wedding guests arrive at Camptown from Tuesday to Thursday for a weekend ceremony, with Wednesdays experiencing the largest growth, Wendell said. ""You see people at the pool with laptops, taking calls on the nature paths.""The Kimpton Armory, a boutique hotel in downtown Bozeman, Montana, also has experienced an uptick in midweek wedding guest check-ins, according to Courtney Reeves, director of sales and marketing at the hotel. To accommodate those and other guests hoping to do some office work during their stay, the hotel has upgraded its free Wi-Fi, boosted coverage on the roof deck, added free printing services and opened up its meeting rooms, when they aren't booked, for people who want to drop in with a laptop for a while.Michael Bruno, owner of Valley Rock Inn, in Sloatsburg, New York, said one-quarter of wedding-related stays in the last year extended two to three days beyond the weekend, an increase compared with pre-pandemic times. Guests who stay extra days can take advantage of guided hikes and bike rides, yoga and spin classes. Remote-work capabilities include free high-speed internet throughout the property, so guests can work indoors or outdoors, and meeting rooms are equipped with large screens and whiteboards. Copying and printing are available as well.The growth of extended-stay wedding guests happened naturally, said Wendell, of Camptown, but looking toward the 2024 wedding season, he said, ""We are marketing to that group."" When wedding inquiries come in now, planners highlight the appeal of the property's remote-work capabilities and longer stays.""The area is very much a weekend destination,"" he said, so filling midweek rooms really helps the business.Sometimes an unexpectedly large group of remote-working early birds causes a last-minute change of plans.Ben Cole, 35, who works at a financial startup, and Max Alderman, 34, a law clerk, didn't expect that half of their 100 wedding guests would arrive days before their Sunday wedding last summer in Portland, Oregon.""We thought we'd have a handful of people show up on Thursday,"" Cole said, and the couple had planned a few light activities for them. But so many extra guests with remote-work-friendly jobs wanted to join in that the grooms had to turn to their wedding planner to find options that would work for large groups and then ask guests to help manage each outing.","A growing number of wedding guests are bringing a new kind of plus-one to the festivities: their remote jobs.When Anna Sullivan, a 25-year-old who works in digital marketing, and Taylor Brandenberger, a 26-year-old home inspector, got married last month in East Lansing, Michigan, 10 of the bride's friends started the wedding weekend a few days early.They rented anAirbnb where they could work remotely during the day and then got together for dinner and hangouts in the evening -- all without taking any time off.Many of the guests even stayed through Monday, flying home in the evening after they had logged off.""The wedding day goes by in a blur,"" said the bride, who has since changed her last name to Brandenberger.

According to the Pew Research Center, one-third of U.S. workers currently have some freedom to work remotely, even if it is just one or two days a week.Wedding guests who are lucky enough to have those hybrid schedules are increasingly using them to spend a few more days wherever the celebration takes them, and hotels, wedding planners and couples are taking note and making changes.Anna Brandenberger's mother, who lives four hours away and works remotely in billing for a trading company in Chicago, came a week before the wedding.""She'd work during the day and we'd get together at night to make flower arrangements and bake together for the wedding,"" Brandenberger said. ""It was such a big stress relief to have her nearby.""Attendance may even hinge on the possibility of remote work. The Brandenbergers planned their ceremony and reception on a Friday night to save money on renting the space. That meant some guests from out of town who had to be physically at work that day and couldn't take time off weren't able to attend, Anna Brandenberger said.Some couples choose to make a weekend destination out of their ceremony. Such weddings have long been a boon to hotels and resorts, many of which also added workspaces and upgraded their Wi-Fi to cater to remote workers during the pandemic. Now the two trends are converging.At Camptown, a 50-room hotel that opened this year in Leeds, New York, at the foot of the Catskill Mountains, wedding-related stays have been getting longer, said Stephen Wendell, CEO of Mountain Shore Properties, which owns the hotel. When guests realize they can work from the lodge, which offers high-speed internet, workspaces and a pantry of snacks available to buy on the honor system, he said, ""they start thinking about relaxing and getting into wedding mode and extending their bookings.""Currently, about 20% of wedding guests arrive at Camptown from Tuesday to Thursday for a weekend ceremony, with Wednesdays experiencing the largest growth, Wendell said. ""You see people at the pool with laptops, taking calls on the nature paths.""The Kimpton Armory, a boutique hotel in downtown Bozeman, Montana, also has experienced an uptick in midweek wedding guest check-ins, according to Courtney Reeves, director of sales and marketing at the hotel. To accommodate those and other guests hoping to do some office work during their stay, the hotel has upgraded its free Wi-Fi, boosted coverage on the roof deck, added free printing services and opened up its meeting rooms, when they aren't booked, for people who want to drop in with a laptop for a while.Michael Bruno, owner of Valley Rock Inn, in Sloatsburg, New York, said one-quarter of wedding-related stays in the last year extended two to three days beyond the weekend, an increase compared with pre-pandemic times. Guests who stay extra days can take advantage of guided hikes and bike rides, yoga and spin classes. Remote-work capabilities include free high-speed internet throughout the property, so guests can work indoors or outdoors, and meeting rooms are equipped with large screens and whiteboards. Copying and printing are available as well.The growth of extended-stay wedding guests happened naturally, said Wendell, of Camptown, but looking toward the 2024 wedding season, he said, ""We are marketing to that group."" When wedding inquiries come in now, planners highlight the appeal of the property's remote-work capabilities and longer stays.""The area is very much a weekend destination,"" he said, so filling midweek rooms really helps the business.Sometimes an unexpectedly large group of remote-working early birds causes a last-minute change of plans.Ben Cole, 35, who works at a financial startup, and Max Alderman, 34, a law clerk, didn't expect that half of their 100 wedding guests would arrive days before their Sunday wedding last summer in Portland, Oregon.""We thought we'd have a handful of people show up on Thursday,"" Cole said, and the couple had planned a few light activities for them. But so many extra guests with remote-work-friendly jobs wanted to join in that the grooms had to turn to their wedding planner to find options that would work for large groups and then ask guests to help manage each outing.",860,"[""Anna Brandenberger"", ""Taylor Brandenberger"", ""Stephen Wendell"", ""Courtney Reeves"", ""Michael Bruno"", ""Ben Cole"", ""Max Alderman""]","[""Anna Brandenberger"", ""Taylor Brandenberger"", ""Stephen Wendell"", ""Ben Cole""]",19bOvfWIrNRcQ9h1KI3779tjg5oFQ6jGV

Monrovia, Liberia– On January 22, 2018, a cheering crowd welcomed George Weah to the Samuel K Doe Sports Complex in Paynesville, outside Liberia’s capital, Monrovia. But the man once crowned the world’s best footballer was not there to add to his 75 matches for the Lone Stars, Liberia’s senior national football team. It was hisinaugurationas the West African nation’s 25th president. Those present, like many Liberians glued to television sets at home and in the diaspora were brimming with hope at the expected transformation that his presidency would bring, just as his football career had given them joy and pride. “It is my belief that the most effective way to directly impact the poor and to narrow the gap between rich and poor is to ensure that public resources do not end up in the pockets of government officials,” Weah said in his inaugural address. Weah had gone from a slum dweller in one of the poorest areas of one of the world’s poorest countries to the only African winner of the Ballon d’Or, football’s most coveted prize, and toLiberia’s highest office. His election win made headlines across the world, and his inauguration speech seemed as convincing as his ball-striking prowess had been. “I further believe that the overwhelming mandate I received from the Liberian people is a mandate to end corruption in public service,” Weah told rapturous supporters, many of whom had survived corruption-fueled, back-to-back civil wars in the 1990s and 2000s, which killed more than 250,000 people. Almost six years on, Liberia’s most famous citizen dead or alive has become unpopular to the point of losing the presidential vote to a man whom he defeated in 2017. Last week, Weah, 57, concededdefeatto former Vice President Joseph Boakai, 78, after a November 14 run-off. There are several reasons why voters denied Weah a second term, including his failure to establish a war crimes court for the country and the ripple effects of adrug epidemic. However, one issue stands out: corruption. It drove some of the biggestproteststhe country has seen since the end of Liberia’s second civil war in 2003. “[Weah] promised to ‘weed out the menace of corruption’; however, greed and graft have become the hallmarks of his presidency,” said Robtel Neajai Pailey, a Liberian academic, activist and author based in London. “President Weah squandered practically every opportunity to score the country’s most important goal of socioeconomic transformation.”      For decades, Liberia has been ranked as one of the world’s most corrupt countries, but that notoriety reached its lowest depths under Weah. Since 2018, Liberia has averaged 29 points out of a possible 100 on Transparency International’s corruption perceptions index. It currently ranks136 out of 180 countries. In the six years before Weah, Liberia had averaged nearly 39 points. Corruption became synonymous with Weah’s government from the very beginning. First, Weah refused to publicly declare his assets despite doing so in 2005 when he first ran for office. His officials followed suit, ignoring his mandate to declare theirs. But there was more ahead. Just nine months into this presidency, the Liberian press reported the alleged disappearance of 15.5 billion Liberian dollars (US$96m at the time) in banknotes, approximately five percent of the country’s gross domestic product. An inquiry by Kroll, a Philadelphia-based firm funded by the United States government, revealed that the banknotes had not gone missing but had been illegally printed. The investigation also found that US$16.5m had been printed in excess and was unaccounted for. Several officials of the Central Bank of Liberia, including Charles Sirleaf, a son of former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, were charged andjailedfor alleged economic sabotage, bribery, and criminal facilitation but were released, and their charges were later dropped. Two months before the missing banknotes scandal, Weah had injected US$25m into the economy to extract the excess Liberian dollars in circulation. In a national address, Weah said the injection would curb inflation and the depreciation of the Liberian currency. This, too, led to another scandal.  An examination by Liberia’s General Auditing Commission found severaldiscrepancieswith disbursements. Some of the funds had not been accounted for, and staff had not used the government-approved rate for some transactions.      Anderson Miamen, the lead campaigner at the Centre for Accountability and Transparency in Liberia, a partner of Transparency International, believes Liberians voted Weah out because of corruption. “Everywhere we went, people asked questions about the situation of corruption in the country and what the government is doing about it. In the different reports that we’ve done over the years, citizens have expressed disappointment in the government’s lack of strong will to deal with corruption,” Miamen said. After four national auditors died in just over a week in 2020, public mistrust of the Weah government over corruption heightened in the country of 5.2 million people. First, Albert Peters and Gifty Lama of the Liberia Revenue Authority were discovered dead in a car in Monrovia on October 2. Pathologists found they died of carbon monoxide poisoning due to the car’s defective exhaust system. Next, George Fahnboto, another auditor of the Liberia Revenue Authority, died from head wounds in an apparent car crash just outside Monrovia on October 4. Then Emmanuel Nyeswa, head of Liberia’s Internal Auditing Agency, died on October 10, 2020. His body was found lying outside his home with head wounds in the same neighborhood as Fahnboto. The result of his autopsy was inconclusive. The deaths of the auditors sparked outrage. The public rejected the outcomes of the autopsies while the US-based Institute of Internal Auditors asked then-US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to help Liberia investigate the deaths. That assistance did not come. However, the US sanctioned three senior members of Weah’s government over corruption. Nathaniel McGill, minister of state; Bill Twehway, managing director of the Freeport of Monrovia; and Serenius Cephas, solicitor general, were sanctioned for “their involvement in public sector corruption in Liberia”. The trio resigned their posts, but no one was prosecuted. The continued lack of consequences for the elite ultimately hurt the man at the helm, analysts said. “We believe that it played a part in the way people voted,” Miamen said. “He didn’t really live by his word.”               Follow Al Jazeera English:","In six years, Liberia’s most famous citizen became unpopular enough to lose the presidential vote to a man he defeated in 2017.

Ozel, 49, has been serving as the CHP's deputy parliamentary group chairman since 2015 and has been a lawmaker since 2011. He announced his candidacy in September, after Kilicdaroglu and the CHP's painful defeat to President Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling political alliance in May presidential and general elections. Ozel, a pharmacist by trade, received 812 of 1,366 possible votes at a tense, hours-long party congress in Ankara that took two rounds.

Imamoglu supported Ozel in a push for change at the CHP that has long been bogged down by in-fighting.

Honiara, Solomon Islands– On the highway between the airport and Honiara, the Solomon Islands’ capital, a mammoth sports stadium rises from the ground in the tropical heat like an apparition. The new landmark is, by far, the largest building in the small bustling city that is home to just under 100,000 people. The 10,000-seater stadium has been built for the Pacific Games, a regional multi-sport event held in a different Pacific Island country every four years. The games get under way in the Solomon Islands on November 19 and have become a symbol of national pride in the remote southwest Pacific Island nation. “It is the biggest international event ever hosted in the country because it leaves a tangible and long-lasting legacy that will change the lives of people in the Solomon Islands,” Christian Nieng, executive director of the Pacific Games National Hosting Authority (NHA), told Al Jazeera in an interview. “Spectators here will now be sitting in good stadiums where they can watch games and where there are international rules and standards.” Some residents are also optimistic about the event. “It will bring in more revenue for the country through tourism and it will generate more cohesion and unity among Pacific Island countries, and lead to closer economic relations,” said Tony, a 55-year-old resident living close to the stadium. The Solomon Islands, located northeast of Australia, is an archipelago of more than 900 islands with a total population of about 734,000 people. Despite being rich in natural resources, particularly forests and timber, most Solomon Islanders live in rural areas where access to infrastructure, basic services and economic opportunities is poor. Development was set back when a five-year civil conflict, known as the ‘Tensions’, erupted in 1998 and left the country’s economy and infrastructure in ruins. Two decades later, Nieng believes the benefit of the games will be felt far beyond the competition. More than 3,000 local people will gain skills and experience as volunteers who will help with running the event, while more than 1,000 contractors, which employ local citizens, have been engaged to provide goods and services, such as construction and catering, he explained. “We have also witnessed in the past sports being a uniting force. During the Tensions, football was organised and in the field people from different ethnic groups were playing peacefully. We may come from different islands and speak different languages, attend different churches, but in football, we are one. So, the Pacific Games is playing that role as well,” Nieng added. On the public minibus along the road which hugs Honiara’s palm tree-lined waterfront, the local radio station is playing a rallying call to remind passengers about the impending opening ceremony. The event will attract a total of 5,000 athletes from 24 Pacific Island nations, including Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, Fiji and Samoa, who will compete in 24 sports. At the Solomon Islands National Institute of Sport, 1,200 eager contenders have been training in the hope of making the cut for the national team. Jovita Ambrose, a 21-year-old from Malaita Province, participated in the Pacific Games held in Samoa in 2019 and the past two world athletic championships. “I started athletics and running at the age of 17 years during school games. This is the first time the games is happening in the Solomon Islands, so people are very excited to see what will happen,” Ambrose said. Within walking distance of the newly-built games city, which includes the stadium, swimming and tennis centres, is the Burns Creek informal settlement, a sprawling community of 7,000 people. Here, people live on low-lying land close to the sea, their homes laid out along a network of unsealed streets with limited access to basic services, such as power and water. Still, Peter Kosemu, the settlement’s chief, said there was a sense of anticipation in the community. “It is the first of its kind here. People are wondering what it might bring because it is new,” Kosemu said. Some people in the community have been recruited as volunteers, but he said that beyond this, “many people here have found it difficult to access many of the [economic or employment] opportunities associated with the Games”. Near the highway, some residents from the settlement earn money selling fruit, vegetables and betelnut, an addictive nut which induces adrenaline when chewed, at a streetside market. Here, 23-year-old Mercy and her friend, Jennifer, 42, said they were hoping to earn more income from visitors. Ray, another vendor, is more concerned. The 52-year-old has a wife and five children to support and sells betelnut, which will be banned during the games. “This is hard for us. It will be hard to earn money in another way. I have a family to support, and now I will have to go and look for work,” he said. The Solomon Islands is anunderdeveloped countrywith large rural and youth populations. About 25 percent of the population lives below the international poverty line, according to the World Bank, and, even in the capital, residents suffer daily power and water cuts. Meanwhile, 70 percent of the population is aged under 34, with only an estimated 22 percent of the new entrants to the job market each year likely to secure formal employment. Given the country’s immense development needs, the total cost of the event, at $250m, is a major expenditure. Amid some concerns about the cost, the government insists existing budgets have not been affected and 80 percent of the games’ costs have been met by international donors and bilateral partners. “We only received grants from all the countries that are supporting us. There is no loan commitment by the Solomon Islands government to leave behind for our youth or the citizens of this country to repay after the games,” the NHA executive director said. China is the event’s biggest financial supporter, providing half the total funding, including the roughly $71m for construction of the stadium, plus other venues, such as the aquatic centre, tennis courts and hockey field. China’s stake in the event follows Honiara’s diplomatic switch from Taiwan to China in 2019. Since then, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has signed numerous government-to-government agreements on issues from law enforcement to economic development. It was a security pact, bolstering police and military cooperation with China, announced by Sogavare in April last year that saw the Solomon Islands become the focus of an increasingly tautgeopolitical contestamid concerns about the country’s deepening relationship with China in the United States, Australia and even among other Pacific nations. The USreopenedits embassy in Honiara in January, and President Joe Biden has hosted two summits with Pacific Island leaders in Washington to accelerate offers of economic and development assistance. Blake Johnson, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Canberra, told Al Jazeera that China’s funding of the Pacific Games was a sign of its persistence in growing government ties with the Solomon Islands, but “many development needs remain unanswered in the shadow of flashy new stadiums”. “Both China and Solomon Islands governments are hoping the game’s infrastructure will help to demonstrate the benefits of Solomon Islands recognising the ‘One China’ policy, but many actual benefits are yet to be realised,” Johnson said. Nieng and representatives of some other government ministries reject the suggestion that big power rivalry is a factor in the games, claiming that financial support for the event has been global. While the US has not provided any direct assistance,Australiahas stepped up with $11m to assist with athletes’ accommodation, staffing needs, venues and sports equipment. A spokesperson for Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told Al Jazeera that Australia remains “Solomon Islands’ largest bilateral partner” and “Australia’s Pacific Games support will leave a lasting legacy and benefit future generations of Solomon Islanders, including with better school infrastructure and deeper institutional links with Australian sporting bodies.” Funding for the games has also been provided by New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, Korea, India and Indonesia.          Follow Al Jazeera English:","The event has cost an estimated $250m, but the government believes it is money well spent given the potential benefits. Honiara, Solomon Islands– On the highway between the airport and Honiara, the Solomon Islands’ capital, a mammoth sports stadium rises from the ground in the tropical heat like an apparition. The new landmark is, by far, the largest building in the small bustling city that is home to just under 100,000 people. The 10,000-seater stadium has been built for the Pacific Games, a regional multi-sport event held in a different Pacific Island country every four years. The games get under way in the Solomon Islands on November 19 and have become a symbol of national pride in the remote southwest Pacific Island nation. “It is the biggest international event ever hosted in the country because it leaves a tangible and long-lasting legacy that will change the lives of people in the Solomon Islands,” Christian Nieng, executive director of the Pacific Games National Hosting Authority (NHA), told News Agency in an interview. “Spectators here will now be sitting in good stadiums where they can watch games and where there are international rules and standards.” Some residents are also optimistic about the event. “It will bring in more revenue for the country through tourism and it will generate more cohesion and unity among Pacific Island countries, and lead to closer economic relations,” said Tony, a 55-year-old resident living close to the stadium.

Both men instead provided prepared statements to detectives. David Mackintosh, who represented Northampton South between 2015-17, denies concealing the true source of money paid to his campaign. Howard Grossman, a property developer, has also pleaded not guilty. At Warwick Crown Court, the jury was read a series of facts which the prosecution and defence agreed upon, as well as both men's police statements. These included how most of the £39,000 donor money came from Mr Grossman's company 1st Land Ltd, which was set up to facilitate Northampton Town Football Club's stadium redevelopment.  He was leader of Northampton Borough Council when its cabinet agreed a £12m loan to do the work, the jury heard.  Mr Grossman was interviewed under caution in October 2017 and Mr Mackintosh in March 2018. In his statement, Mr Grossman said when the pair first met in 2013, he had been ""enthused"" by Mr Mackintosh.  Both men shared similar politics, he wrote, and he ""could make a difference to life in the area by making a donation"". He said his family helped set up the Amy Winehouse Foundation and he had booked a table for Mr Mackintosh at the foundation's first ball in 2013 where he sat with former Northampton Town chairman David Cardoza. Mr Grossman's statement included his assertion he had been told by the Northampton South Constituency Association (NSCA) chairman Suresh Patel to make the donations via third parties as it ""might look odd or raise eyebrows"".

One, Al Mayfield, had met him during a visit to the EastEnders TV set in May 2014, the statement said. Mr Mayfield had ""made me aware he was a Conservative supporter"" and there was ""no reason to have any concerns about this donation"". Both defendants attended their police interviews voluntarily, the jury heard, and it was agreed by prosecution and defence there had been no bribery or corruption offences. Mr Mackintosh, of Station Road, Northampton, and Mr Grossman, 61, of Caldecote Gardens, Bushey, Hertfordshire, both deny two offences under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.

When MS Dhoni swung his bat to a score a six and deliver India’s second ICC Cricket World Cup title at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium in 2011, more than 700km (434 miles) away in Hyderabad, a 16-year-old Mohammed Siraj was cultivating his dream of playing for India. On Wednesday, the 29-year-old will steam in with the ball in his hand as the world’s top one-day international (ODI) bowler when India take on New Zealand in the 2023 tournament’s first semifinal at the same storied venue. The tall and athletic pacer from Hyderabad in southern India has come a long way from bowling in slippers on dusty grounds to becoming a household name in the cricket-obsessed country. In September, he took fiveSri Lankan wickets in 16 balls– the joint fastest five-wicket haul in ODI history – and ended with figures of 6-21 as India romped to a 10-wicket win in the Asia Cup final. Siraj’s performance left his captain, Rohit Sharma, befuddled as he spoke about the fast bowlerafter the match. “It was Siraj’s day to be a hero, and he stood up for the team,” Rohit said, heaping praise on the right-arm quick, who bowled a seven-over opening spell, which also saw him run all the way down the long-on boundary to field off his own bowling. “He wanted to keep going. I wanted him to keep going, but our trainer asked him to stop to maintain his fitness [for the World Cup].” Come the World Cup and its biggest group-stage match betweenIndia and Pakistan, Siraj stood up for his team once more. He dismissed Pakistan’s in-form batter Abdullah Shafique to break the opening stand and followed up with the prize wicket of their star captain, Babar Azam. Shubman Gill 🤝 Mohammed Siraj India players claim the 🔝 positions in the latest@MRFWorldwideICC Men's ODI Player Rankings 🤩#CWC23| Details 👇https://t.co/nRyTqAP48upic.twitter.com/B3DuA4sfYx — ICC (@ICC)November 8, 2023  Lovingly nicknamed “Miya Bhai” (sir, brother) by his Indian teammates, Siraj first picked up the game as a teenager. He would skip lessons in school and then in college to go play cricket on the dusty expanse of the Eidgah (Eid prayer venue) ground in Hyderabad. “It would be jam-packed with at least 15 matches taking place at the same time,” Siraj said during a podcast with his Indian Premier League (IPL) team Royal Challengers Bangalore. His father, Mohammed Ghous, drove an auto rickshaw all day, and his mother, Shabana Begum, worked as a cleaner and cook in the neighbourhood. Siraj’s love for the game often landed him in trouble with his mother, but Ghous always backed his son’s ambition. The teenager’s first taste of competitive cricket came with his uncle’s club team. “I took nine wickets in my first ever club match and played in the local league for four years,” Siraj told Indian sports journalist Gaurav Kapoor in an interview. The teenaged Siraj would play in slippers because his daily pocket money of 70 rupees (less than $1) was not enough to buy sports shoes. “I bowled in slippers until I was 19. You need money to buy shoes, and I didn’t have any. Had I asked my parents to buy me shoes, they would have probably thrashed me with a pair,” he joked. The cricket-mad teenager had been bowling with a tennis ball until he was selected by a local club that offered to pay for his services in addition to offering a cricket kit and a pair of spikes. Siraj’s eyes lit up when he saw the shoes but “didn’t know why they had nails sticking out at the bottom”. “They handed me the new ball right away – it was my first time holding a proper cricket ball – and I didn’t know what to do with the seam. I only knew how to run in and bowl fast, so I did.” Siraj took five wickets in his first match as he left the opposition beaten by his pace. Of his 70-rupee pocket money, 40 now went towards fuelling up his trusty old motorcycle that needed a long run-up to get going, much like the fast bowler himself. “Once I was playing regular cricket, I used to go to the local ground on my bike while the other players arrived in big cars, and I would feel so ashamed of having to push-start my bike that I waited for every one to leave before making my way home,” he said. Once Siraj had figured out what to do with the ball’s seam, how to bowl in and out swing, he was knocking on the doors of regional teams. “When I was named amongst the under-23 probables, I got struck by dengue fever and could feel the opportunity slip away,” he recalled. Determined not to let his chance go, Siraj turned up for practice on his dad’s auto rickshaw and participated in the full session out of sheer passion for the game. Siraj’s under-23 exploits brought him a chance to bowl in the nets to the country’s stars during IPL practice sessions. “I pelted KL Rahul with so many bouncers that he got mad at me and asked me if I knew how to bowl anything else,” Siraj said. But it wasn’t only Rahul who saw him that day. Siraj had caught the eye of bowling coach Bharat Arun, who later worked with India’s national team, and he picked the lanky pacer in Hyderabad’s squad for Ranji Trophy – India’s premier domestic tournament – in 2015. Siraj knew his career was on an upwards trajectory, but something kept bothering him. “I wanted to make enough money to put my parents at ease,” he said. That money came two years later when he was picked in the 2016 IPL auction for 26 million rupees ($312,200) by the Hyderabad franchise. “When I left home to join the [IPL] team, I told my brother to find a house for our family by the time I was back.” Siraj moved to star batter and then-India captain Virat Kohli’s RCB team a year later. He loves to tell the story of hosting his star-studded, Kohli-led IPL team at his new home in Hyderabad. “Virat Bhai told me he couldn’t make it to the dinner because of a stiff back, and we are all heartbroken, but in fact he wanted to surprise me and my family. It’s the best surprise any one has ever given me.” Siraj has a framed pic with Virat Kohli on the wall & MRF bat on the shelf at his home. Beautiful bond between Kohli & Siraj.pic.twitter.com/ud27H3aLyN — Johns. (@CricCrazyJohns)May 16, 2023  During his tenure as India’s all-format captain, Kohli showed a special liking to out-and-out fast bowlers because they matched his aggressive approach towards the game. In Siraj, Kohli had found one such cog in the wheel. The bowler, who is a self-confessed Kohli fan, added a new threat to India’s bowling attack and took a five-wicket haul on an emotional first Test series in Australia. Ghous passed away while the Indian team was under quarantine prior to the series, and Siraj’s family urged him to stay in Australia to fulfill his biggest supporter’s lifelong dream. When Siraj lined up with his teammates for India’s national anthem before his first Test match, tears rolled down his face. “I had finally fulfilled dad’s dream, but he wasn’t around to see it,” he would say after the match. “It also made me realise how far I had come. ‘Kahan thay, kahan agaye’ [From there to here].” Siraj, now a regular name on the Indian teamsheet, has bagged 12 wickets in the World Cup so far and will be raring to go against a strong New Zealand batting lineup. When he lines up to represent India in his 40th and most important ODI match at the Indian home of cricket on Wednesday, Siraj will be hundreds of kilometres and 14 strife-filled years away from the dusty, small-town and village grounds of his childhood.

Hezbollah said it also used the heavy-duty Burkan missile in another attack against an Israeli border position.The Israeli army said that, in response to fire towards Israel, its helicopters and fighters jets had struck ""terrorist infrastructure"" belonging to Hezbollah, as well as rocket launch sites.Lebanon's official National News Agency said the Israeli army had shelled several locations in southern Lebanon in response.Hezbollah says it has been acting in support of Hamas since the Palestinian Islamist movement's October 7 attacks on Israel, which Israeli officials say killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw about 240 people taken hostage.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and its retaliatory air and ground offensive in the Gaza Strip has killed nearly 15,000 people, thousands of them children, according to the Hamas government of the Palestinian territory.'Great victory' Thursday's exchange of fire came as Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian met with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.In a statement, Hezbollah said Amir-Abdollahian and Nasrallah ""reviewed the latest developments in Palestine, Lebanon and the region, and... the efforts made to end the Israeli aggression against the Gaza Strip"".Amir-Abdollahian, who warned on Wednesday that the war could spiral out of control, left Beirut for Doha after their meeting, Iran's Nour news agency reported.Iran, which backs Hamas and Hezbollah, celebrated the October 7 attacks but denied any direct involvement.The violence between Israel and Hezbollah has claimed at least 109 lives in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters, but also at least 14 civilians, including three journalists, according to an AFP count.Six Israeli soldiers and three civilians have been killed on the Israeli side, according to the authorities.Hezbollah held funerals on Thursday for militants killed in southern Lebanon, including the son of a member of parliament.Abbas Raad, the son of Hezbollah MP Mohamed Raad, was killed with four others in an Israeli strike on a house in Beit Yahoun village on Wednesday evening, a source close to the family told AFP, requesting anonymity.

The film and television industry could rightly celebrate the conclusion this week of a bruising, protracted work stoppage that began in May when the Writers Guild hit the picket lines and gathered more force when Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists members walked out in mid-July. The strikes were historic in their length and cost, causing an estimated $6 billion in economic loss and leaving hundreds of thousands out of work. As Hollywood on Thursday began rushing back to production and stars again hit red carpets, many were surely still nursing wounds from a bitter feud with the studios, even after a deal that the guild says won actors a hefty boost to minimum pay and protections over the use of artificial intelligence. SAG-AFTRA’s board was to vote on approving the contract Friday afternoon. But as actors swap their picket signs for audition sides and call sheets, they’ll be returning to an industry still in the midst of painful transformation and streaming upheaval. The strikes were prompted largely by the streaming wars, a digital land-rush to populate platforms like Disney+ and HBO Max (now just “Max”) with enough content to rival Netflix. That helter-skelter transition threw much of the economics of entertainment out of whack. One of the most contentious issues of SAG-AFTRA’s negotiations with the studios was the union’s attempt to win a percentage — 1 or 2% — of streaming revenue, to replace lost residuals. In the end, the actors accepted a bonus tied to viewership. But even before the strike, every studio was reexamining its streaming strategy. After several years of rampant green lights, most are pulling back, looking to make fewer series and movies, cutting staff and desperately seeking a path toward profitability. Wall Street, no longer enamored with subscriber numbers, wants to see profit, too. The aftermath of the strike may look less like a party and more like a streaming hangover. “The streaming business is completely screwed up. There’s too much content and nobody seems to be able to make any profit from it,” says Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the USC Annenberg Innovation Lab and author of “The End of Reality: How Four Billionaires are Selling a Fantasy Future of the Metaverse, Mars, and Crypto.” Both strikes, Taplin says, were successful because the guilds gained bulwarks against potential decimation by artificial intelligence. But the road ahead, during which he expects linear television to collapse and some streaming services to go out of business, will be strained. “The whole business is in a complete uproar,” says Taplin. “It will sort itself out in the next three to five years, but it’s going to be painful.” This is the world that awaits actors as they rush back to sets: Better pay but fewer jobs and intense competition. Puck’s Matt Belloni wrote: “What should be a time of relief and celebration in Hollywood is more akin to what soldiers experience in countless war movies — the horrors of battle give way to the equally grim reality of the new world for which they fought.” Still, the strikes recalibrated power in Hollywood, winning gains for actors and writers and rallying union support throughout the industry. More battles loom. The contract for International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents crew members, expires at the end of July. Meanwhile, for months studios have signaled they’re downsizing. Earlier this week, Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger in an earnings call where he touted the financial benefits of more than 8,000 job cuts, said the company is focused on consolidating: “Make less, focus more on quality.” “At the time the pandemic hit, we were leaning into a huge increase in how much we were making,” Iger said. “And I’ve always felt that quantity can be actually a negative when it comes to quality. And I think that’s exactly what happened. We lost some focus.” Netflix, which earlier set its sights on a new original movie every week, has said it’s now aiming for about half that. Hulu, which Disney plans to bundle with Disney+ after acquiring Comcast’s stake, is slimming down. Peacock lost $2.8 billion this year, Comcast has said; it announced layoffs to its marketing department Thursday. Warner Bros. Discovery chief executive David Zaslav has taken drastic steps to get Max in order while the studio post-merger carries $43 billion in debt. “This is a generational disruption we’re going through,” Zaslav said Wednesday. “Going through that with a streaming service that’s losing billions of dollars is really, really difficult to go on offense.” Cancellations have grown more commonplace as streamers get more selective. Due in part to the strikes, series production will dip for the first time in years in 2023 after reaching an all-time high last year, when 599 original series were made. Peak TV, some say , is over. But there are still huge amounts of money being thrown around. Apple Studios, for one, is behind two of the fall’s biggest budget films in Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon” and Ridley Scott’s “Napoleon.” Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA’s lead negotiator, remains optimistic about what’s ahead. ""I recognize that during a strike, sometimes rhetoric gets heated. People sometimes say things with the intention of sort of generating a reaction,” Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said Wednesday. “And so I think really we will see over the coming days, weeks and months what the industry’s real intentions are.

The dead would be buried and Israel would be arguing with the United Nations about how much cement could come into Gaza for rebuilding.  But this war is not like that. It is not just because of the enormity of the killing, first by Hamas on 7 October, mostly of Israeli civilians, followed by Israel's ""mighty vengeance"" as its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it, which has mostly killed Palestinian civilians.  This war is different to the others because it comes at a time when the fault lines that divide the Middle East are rumbling. For at least two decades, the most serious rift in the region's fractured geopolitical landscape has been between the friends and allies of Iran, and the friends and allies of the United States.  The core of Iran's network, sometimes called the ""axis of resistance"", is made up of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis in Yemen and assorted Iraqi militias that are armed and trained by Iran. The Iranians have also supported Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza.  Iran is also getting closer to Russia and China. Iran has become a significant part of Russia's war effort in Ukraine. China buys a great deal of Iranian oil.  The longer the war in Gaza goes on, and as Israel kills more Palestinian civilians and destroys tens of thousands of homes, the greater the risk of conflict involving some members of those two camps.  The border between Israel and Lebanon is heating up, slowly and steadily. Neither Israel nor Hezbollah want a full-scale war. But as they trade increasingly heavy punches, the risks of uncontrolled escalation will grow.  The Houthis in Yemen have been launching missiles and drones towards Israel. They have all been brought down, so far, by Israel's air defences or by US Navy warships in the Red Sea.  In Iraq, militias supported by Iran have attacked American bases. The US retaliated at some of their sites in Syria. Again, all sides are trying to limit escalation, but controlling the tempo of military action is always difficult.  On America's side are Israel, the Gulf oil states, Jordan and Egypt. The US continues to give strong support to Israel, even though it is clear that President Joe Biden is uncomfortable about the way Israel is killing so many Palestinian civilians. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has said publicly that too many Palestinian civilians are being killed.  America's Arab allies have all condemned what Israel is doing and called for a ceasefire. The sight of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fleeing their homes in northern Gaza and walking down the main road south raises the ghosts of Israel's victory over the Arabs in its independence war in 1948.  More than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes at gunpoint by the Israelis, events referred to by Palestinians as al Nakba - the catastrophe. The descendants of the 1948 refugees include much of the population of the Gaza Strip.  Dangerous talk by some of the extreme Jewish nationalists who are supporting the government of Benjamin Netanyahu about imposing another Nakba on Palestinians is alarming Arab states in America's camp, particularly Jordan and Egypt. One minister in Netanyahu's government even mused about dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza to deal with Hamas. He was reprimanded but not sacked.  All that can be dismissed as the ravings of the lunatic fringe, but it is being taken seriously in Jordan and Egypt. Not nuclear weapons, of which Israel has a large and undeclared arsenal, but the prospect of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians being forced over their borders.  As for the war itself in Gaza, senior western diplomats from countries that are firm allies of Israel's allies, told the BBC that ending the war, and dealing with the aftermath will be ""difficult and messy"".  One said that ""the only way through will be rebuilding a political horizon for Palestinians"". That was a reference to an independent Palestine alongside Israel, the so called two-state solution, a failed idea that survives only as a slogan.  Reviving it, perhaps in the context of a wider accommodation between Israel and the Arabs, is an ambitious plan, and perhaps the best idea around. But in the current atmosphere of pain, alarm and hatred it will be very difficult to deliver.  It won't happen under the current leaderships of both Palestinians and Israelis.  Prime Minister Netanyahu has not revealed his plan for the day after the fighting ends in Gaza, but he has rejected America's idea of installing a government led by the Palestinian Authority, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas and ejected by Hamas from Gaza in 2007.  The second part of the American plan is for negotiations on a two-state solution, something that Benjamin Netanyahu has opposed throughout his political life.  Not only is Mr Netanyahu against independence for the Palestinians. His survival as prime minister depends on support from Jewish extremists who believe the entire territory between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean was given to the Jewish people by God and should all be inside Israel's borders.  Many Israelis want him out, blaming him for the security and intelligence failures that allowed the attacks of 7 October to happen.  The Palestinian President Abbas is in his late 80s and is discredited in the eyes of potential voters, though he has not subjected himself to the ballot box since 2005. The Palestinian Authority cooperates with Israel on security in the West Bank but cannot protect its own people from armed Jewish settlers.  Leaderships change, eventually. If this terrible war in Gaza doesn't force the Israelis, Palestinians and their powerful friends to try again to make peace, then the only future is more war.

This comes after Pyongyang claimed to have successfully launched a spy satellite into space. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said the launch threatened South Korea's security. Seoul said it would resume surveillance flights along its border with North Korea, breaching a no-fly zone established under the military pact.  Some analysts have said these developments could escalate tensions further. Pyongyang fired a rocket, said to contain its Malligyong-1 spy satellite, late on Tuesday and hailed the launch as a ""success"". On Wednesday, South Korea's military confirmed that the satellite had entered orbit but noted that it was too soon to tell if it was actually functioning, though both it and the US strongly condemned the launch.  US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said the move risked ""destabilising the security situation in the region and beyond."" Developing a functioning spy satellite is a major part of North Korea's five-year military plan, set out by its leader Kim Jong Un in January 2021. The technology could in theory enable Pyongyang to monitor the movement of US and South Korean troops and weapons on the Korean Peninsula, allowing it to spot incoming threats. It would also allow the North to plot its nuclear attacks with more precision. North Korea's space agency, the National Aerospace Technology Administration, said the launch was an attempt to bolster the country's self-defence capabilities, in the face of ""dangerous military moves"" by its enemies. Pyongyang added that it planned to launch several more spy satellites ""in a short space of time"".  Some analysts are sceptical as to whether the satellite is advanced enough to be effective. Jang Young-geun, who runs the Missile Centre at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy, predicted that given past attempts, the resolution of the satellite's camera is ""probably not at a level to allow for detailed military reconnaissance."" Nonetheless, he said, a low resolution is ""better than nothing"", as an attack - regardless of the target - will need information to make it more effective.  Ankit Panda, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, also reckoned that while the satellite could enhance the effectiveness of North Korea's armed forces, it could conversely have a ""stabilising effect"" on the Peninsula. ""It could make Pyongyang act less skittishly in crises,"" he said. ""For instance, it could use its satellites to verify that the US and South Korea were, in fact, not surging their forces to prepare for a major attack.""  This is the North's third attempt this year to put a spy satellite into orbit, after two previous attempts in May and August failed. South Korean officials said they believed Pyongyang had received technical support from Moscow, which allowed it to overcome the hurdles that had led to its previous failures. When Kim Jong Un met Vladimir Putin at the Vostochny space centre in Russia's far east in September, the Russian leader hinted he would help Mr Kim build satellites. The US and South Korea believe the North is sending Russia arms to use in Ukraine, and that Moscow may have agreed to share its military expertise in return. But Mr Panda said there was no evidence that Pyongyang had received Russia's technical assistance and implemented it. ""This was North Korea's third launch attempt and they've been carrying out their own research and development on space systems for a while now,"" Mr Panda noted. Jo Bee Yun, an associate research fellow at the Korea Institute for Defence Analysis (KIDA), added that the time was too limited for Russia to have provided ""game-changing"" technology, but that ""significant transfers"" could be expected in the future. Mr Kim and then South Korean President Moon Jae-in signed the Comprehensive Military Agreement in 2018, in an attempt to de-escalate tensions between their two countries and prevent a conflict erupting. It limited military movements by both sides near the border, removed guard posts, banned live-fire drills, and created a no fly-zone. But the South Korean government had recently argued that the deal left it vulnerable to an attack, by prohibiting it from flying surveillance aircraft and reconnaissance drones along the border. Members of South Korea's National Security Council met in the early hours of Wednesday morning, followed by its defence chiefs and cabinet. All agreed the country should restart surveillance operations along the border with immediate effect and with the president's backing. This increased surveillance will allow the South to monitor North Korean outposts and long-range artillery, previously hidden behind its mountain slopes. Seoul currently relies on US spy satellites to monitor the North, but is planning to launch its first home-built model into space at the end of November. Some analysts warn that the suspension of the military pact could escalate tensions and make cross-border skirmishes more likely. Hong Min, from the Korea Institute for National Unification, pointed out that the deal had significantly reduced the number of cross-border incidents and had been successful in deterring the North. He said Seoul risked providing it with ""the justification to carry out further provocations."" However Jo Bee Yun of KIDA, does not believe the suspension would increase tensions, noting that Pyongyang has been regularly launching missiles since 2022. ""The cycle of provocations has already resumed. South Korea had to respond sometime or another.""","South Korea has suspended parts of its 2018 agreement with the North aimed at lowering military tensions. This comes after Pyongyang claimed to have successfully launched a spy satellite into space. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said the launch threatened South Korea's security. Seoul said it would resume surveillance flights along its border with North Korea, breaching a no-fly zone established under the military pact.  Some analysts have said these developments could escalate tensions further. Pyongyang fired a rocket, said to contain its Malligyong-1 spy satellite, late on Tuesday and hailed the launch as a ""success"". On Wednesday, South Korea's military confirmed that the satellite had entered orbit but noted that it was too soon to tell if it was actually functioning, though both it and the US strongly condemned the launch.  US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said the move risked ""destabilising the security situation in the region and beyond."" Developing a functioning spy satellite is a major part of North Korea's five-year military plan, set out by its leader Kim Jong Un in January 2021. The technology could in theory enable Pyongyang to monitor the movement of US and South Korean troops and weapons on the Korean Peninsula, allowing it to spot incoming threats. It would also allow the North to plot its nuclear attacks with more precision. North Korea's space agency, the National Aerospace Technology Administration, said the launch was an attempt to bolster the country's self-defence capabilities, in the face of ""dangerous military moves"" by its enemies. Pyongyang added that it planned to launch several more spy satellites ""in a short space of time"".  Some analysts are sceptical as to whether the satellite is advanced enough to be effective. Jang Young-geun, who runs the Missile Centre at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy, predicted that given past attempts, the resolution of the satellite's camera is ""probably not at a level to allow for detailed military reconnaissance."" Nonetheless, he said, a low resolution is ""better than nothing"", as an attack - regardless of the target - will need information to make it more effective.  Ankit Panda, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, also reckoned that while the satellite could enhance the effectiveness of North Korea's armed forces, it could conversely have a ""stabilising effect"" on the Peninsula. ""It could make Pyongyang act less skittishly in crises,"" he said. ""For instance, it could use its satellites to verify that the US and South Korea were, in fact, not surging their forces to prepare for a major attack.""  This is the North's third attempt this year to put a spy satellite into orbit, after two previous attempts in May and August failed. South Korean officials said they believed Pyongyang had received technical support from Moscow, which allowed it to overcome the hurdles that had led to its previous failures. When Kim Jong Un met Vladimir Putin at the Vostochny space centre in Russia's far east in September, the Russian leader hinted he would help Mr Kim build satellites. The US and South Korea believe the North is sending Russia arms to use in Ukraine, and that Moscow may have agreed to share its military expertise in return. But Mr Panda said there was no evidence that Pyongyang had received Russia's technical assistance and implemented it. ""This was North Korea's third launch attempt and they've been carrying out their own research and development on space systems for a while now,"" Mr Panda noted. Jo Bee Yun, an associate research fellow at the Korea Institute for Defence Analysis (KIDA), added that the time was too limited for Russia to have provided ""game-changing"" technology, but that ""significant transfers"" could be expected in the future. Mr Kim and then South Korean President Moon Jae-in signed the Comprehensive Military Agreement in 2018, in an attempt to de-escalate tensions between their two countries and prevent a conflict erupting. It limited military movements by both sides near the border, removed guard posts, banned live-fire drills, and created a no fly-zone. But the South Korean government had recently argued that the deal left it vulnerable to an attack, by prohibiting it from flying surveillance aircraft and reconnaissance drones along the border. Members of South Korea's National Security Council met in the early hours of Wednesday morning, followed by its defence chiefs and cabinet.

The thousands of civilian casualties and desperate humanitarian conditions have alarmed Arab allies, but also stirred an extraordinary level of criticism from within his own administration.  ""I'm stunned by the intensity,"" said Aaron David Miller, who worked as an adviser on Arab-Israeli relations during a 25 year tenure at the US State Department.   ""I've never seen anything quite like this.""   Several internal memos have been sent to Secretary of State Antony Blinken through a channel, established after the Vietnam war,  which allows employees to register disapproval of policy.   An open letter is also said to be circulating at the Agency for International Development (USAID). Another has been dispatched to the White House by political appointees and staff members representing dozens of government agencies. Another to members of Congress by staffers on Capitol Hill. Much of this dissent is private, and the signatures are often anonymous out of concerns the protest might affect jobs, so the full scale of it is not clear. But according to leaks cited by multiple reports, hundreds of people have signed on to the wave of opposition.  An administration official has told the BBC that these concerns are very real and there are active discussions about them. At a minimum, the letters are asking that President Biden demand an immediate ceasefire, and push Israel much harder to allow for more humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. In some cases, the language is stronger, echoing the rhetoric of young political activists and apparently reflecting to some degree a generational divide that is more critical of Israel and sympathetic to Palestinians. The letters condemn the atrocities carried out by Hamas during its surprise 7 October attack that killed around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians. More than 12,000 have been killed in Gaza by Israel since that attack, according to the latest figure from the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has said it is trying to minimise civilian casualties in the war in Gaza but has not been successful, blaming this on Hamas. The high number of Palestinian deaths is a ""font of the dismay"" in the administration, according to Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley, a former US diplomat who is now president of the Middle East Policy Council.  The administration's support for the Israeli military operation appears for many ""far too much of a one-sided position for the US government"", she said. Ms Abercrombie-Winstanley signed dissent cables during her career and has been consulted by current employees about whether they should do so now. These memos feel like they have a ""broader reach"" than others, she said, drawing in people who are not necessarily working on the specific issue at hand.   Ms Abercrombie-Winstanley believes the chorus of dismay has contributed to significant shifts in US language and approach, since the days immediately after the Hamas attack when President Biden pledged unwavering support for Israel in an emotional address. Propelled by the destruction in Gaza and growing anger in the Arab world, the administration's rhetoric on protecting civilians has become more insistent. ""Far too many Palestinians have been killed"" in Gaza, Mr Blinken said recently.   He and other senior officials are now treating humanitarian assistance as not only a moral imperative, but a strategic one too.  This is something Mr Blinken highlights when meeting frustrated employees in listening sessions, according to State Department Spokesman Matthew Miller. He makes clear that ""it is the United States of America, not any other country, that was able to secure an agreement to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza"" and ""to get humanitarian pauses"".  The secretary of state is aware of the disquiet simmering in his building and has made a point of addressing it.   ""We're listening,"" he wrote after returning from his recent trip to the Middle East, in an email obtained by the BBC. ""What you share is informing our policy and our messages.""   But it has not changed core policy approaches, nor appeared to have had significant influence on Israel's military campaign.   The Biden administration has become more open about airing its growing divergences with Israel. Mr Blinken has deliberately set out principles of Palestinian governance and statehood for the ""day after"" in Gaza, that Israel's right-wing government rejects.   The president is frequently on the phone to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and senior officials keep up a steady drumbeat of visits to the region, pressing Israel to follow the laws of war. But there's no suggestion the Biden administration is considering using its main leverage, putting conditions on its massive military assistance to Israel, which was ramped up even further after the Hamas attack.   And Biden signalled this week that the US had not given Israel a deadline for its military campaign to end. It will end when Hamas ""no longer maintains the capacity to murder, abuse and just do horrific things"" to Israel, the president said.   The bottom line is that the US and Israel have the same goal, according to Mr Miller, the former adviser at the State Department. Both want to destroy Hamas's capacity as a military organisation so it can never mount a 7 October-style attack again.   With that aim in mind, he said, a full ceasefire that ends hostilities in pursuit of peace does not make operational or political sense.  It only delays war, Mr Miller said, ""because you're not going to get a negotiated ending to this... The tactics may differ, but the objective remains the same"". So what exactly would force President Biden to change course?   Most likely not his internal opposition. For all its ferment, the dissent in the administration is not yet a revolt. Only one State Department official has publicly resigned.   Mr Miller suggests it would more likely take an external event, such as the unconditional release of all the hostages held by Hamas, or a single Israeli operation that results in mass Palestinian casualties, although the bar has been set quite high. There are also political risks for Mr Biden. His solidarity with Israel is shared by Republicans and centrist Democrats, but concerns within the younger and more left-wing elements of the Democratic Party are growing.  His former election campaign staffers have sent their own letter to the president calling for a ceasefire. Gwen Schroeder, who worked on Mr Biden's digital team during the 2020 election, was one of the signatories.   She said Israel's ""disproportionate response"" in Gaza showed that Palestinian lives ""mean less than those of our Israeli allies"". ""I'm not ashamed of getting Biden elected,"" she said, but added: ""I grapple with this every day, you know, is this the administration that I fought so hard for?""  It is too early to say how these sentiments might affect Mr Biden's bid for re-election next year, but it does underline the tightrope that he is walking.   He has been telling Israeli leaders that the way they fight this war will determine what is possible after it ends. How much he is able to influence that is important, because he will be linked with whatever the outcome.

In another attack, Hezbollah said its fighters monitored four Israeli soldiers as they took positions inside a house in the Manara Kibbutz then fired an anti-tank missile that destroyed the house and killed the soldiers. There was no comment on the claim by Israel's military. Hezbollah released at least 21 statements claiming attacks on Thursday alone making it a record in one day since the fighting began last month. The group said its fighters also struck Israeli tanks. The intense fire followed an Israeli airstrike on a house in Beit Yahoun, a village in southern Lebanon, that killed the five senior fighters, including Abbas Raad, the son of the head of Hezbollah’s 13-member parliamentary bloc in Lebanon, Mohammed Raad.

But after ruling out the most popular candidate for the capital, questions remain about whether the party can avoid desertions.

The Morena party, founded by charismatic President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, is made up of disparate elements united only by López Obrador’s outsized personality, but he cannot be reelected and leaves office in ten months. Morena already announced its nominee for the presidential race: former Mexico City mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, who is seen as an unquestioningly faithful follower of the president. García Harfuch gained fame as a tough and effective Mexico City police chief after he survived a 2020 ambush attack by the Jalisco drug cartel on a street in the capital. The brazen attack left him with three bullet wounds, while his two bodyguards and a bystander were killed. Because the capital is so large — at over 9 million inhabitants — the post is considered a governorship, and has been a launching pad for the presidency in the past. But the nomination went to Clara Brugada, the borough president of a rough stretch of low-income neighborhoods on the city’s east side.

Yet after years of incentives and encouragement, Midwest farmers planted cover crops on only about 7% of their land in 2021. That percentage has increased over the years but remains small in part because even as farmers receive extra payments and can see numerous benefits from cover crops, they remain wary. Many worry the practice will hurt their bottom line — and a study last year indicates they could be right. Researchers who used satellite data to examine over 90,000 fields in six Corn Belt states found cover crops can reduce yields of cash crops — the bushels per acre. The smaller the yield, the less money farmers make. “I don’t want to abandon it, but as far as just going whole-hog with planting cover crops, that’s a tough thing for me to do,” said Illinois farmer Doug Downs, who plants cover crops only on a sliver of his land in a relatively flat region of east-central Illinois. Cover crops are plants grown on farmland that otherwise would be bare. While crops like corn and soybeans are growing or soon after harvest, farmers can sow species such as rye or red clover that will grow through winter and into spring. They stabilize soil, reduce fertilizer runoff, store carbon in plant roots and potentially add nutrients to the dirt. The practice is key to government efforts to sequester carbon in farmland to help reduce climate change, since there's general agreement planting the right off-season crops can pull carbon from the air and keep it underground in plant roots. The U.S. Department of Agriculture promotes cover crops through several programs, starting with $44 million in payments during the 2023 fiscal year from the agency's Natural Resources Conservation Service for over 4,700 contracts to plant them on more than 850,000 acres (344,000 hectares). Additional funding was available for conservation practices, including cover crops, through the Inflation Reduction Act. Another program provided $100 million in extra benefits through federal crop insurance coverage to farmers who plant cover crops. There's heightened interest in cover crops for carbon storage, though the effectiveness depends on the soil, plant variety, temperature and other factors. The Natural Resources Defense Council has put so much stock in cover crops that it recently launched a social media campaign with Nick Offerman, featuring the Parks and Recreation TV show actor buried in dirt while promoting the practice. The environmental group has encouraged Congress to give farmers more lucrative financial incentives to plant the crops. The NRDC points to studies that have found cover crops don’t necessarily reduce cash crop yields and can boost growth. And Lara Bryant, the group's deputy director of water and agriculture, notes that while the overall percentage of farmers planting cover crops is small, acreage increased by 50% to about 5% of U.S. cropland from 2012 to 2017, the most recent year USDA data is available. “We have a long way to go but we’ve come a long way in a short amount of time,” Bryant said. However, the 2022 satellite study found yields declined by an average of 5.5% on corn fields where cover crops were used for three or more years. For soybean fields, the decline was 3.5%. The declines varied depending on factors such as cover crop type, soil moisture and soil quality. “I was surprised it was so negative,” said David Lobell, a Stanford University agricultural ecologist who worked on the study published in the journal Global Change Biology with researchers from Illinois and North Carolina. “We rechecked everything and were a little bit surprised.” The study found that rye, the most frequently used cover crop, is especially prone to reducing yields, Lobell said. Rye is less expensive than many cover crops and grows well in many kinds of soil. The study examined farm fields in Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio, using satellite images. Lobell said details from an individual field are less precise than on-the-ground study, but by examining thousands of fields, researchers can reach accurate conclusions. The researchers said farmers need more technical help choosing and maintaining cover crops as well as more government or food industry payments to offset potential yield losses. The federal government and at least 22 states provide financial incentives to farmers — and food companies such as General Mills and PepsiCo pay more to farmers who plant cover crops. Terry Cosby, chief of the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service, acknowledged establishing effective cover crops can take time and some experimenting but said farmers who stick with them should see significant benefits. He noted the Biden administration's allocation of $19.5 billion for climate smart programs over five years and that federal, state and university outreach services can provide technical advice. “It's going to take some trials and errors,"" Cosby said. ""It might fail but over the long term ... it has been proven that you can be very successful with some type of cover crop.” Downs, the Illinois farmer, has tried to incorporate cover crops into some of his operations, especially to control weeds. But he says it hasn’t been easy. In 2019, Downs planted rye in one field but didn’t plant it on an identical field across a road. The spring was wet and the rye field was so soggy, he couldn't get in for weeks to kill the cover crop and plant his soybeans, resulting in a smaller crop. “Growing a cover crop cost me $250 an acre, and I spent $50 an acre doing it,” Downs said. Farmers don't typically harvest and sell cover crops; they frequently use herbicides to kill them before planting their principle crop. Less than 20 miles (32 kilometers) away, fourth-generation farmer Curt Elmore has been “dabbling” in cover crops for a decade, planting varieties like oats and rye on parts of the 2,000 acres (809 hectares) he farms. Elmore seeds cover crops by plane before harvesting his cash crop, but cover crop growth has been spotty, not worth the $40-per-acre cost. Elmore said he’ll keep trying, but it seems that in his area of Illinois, it will take more payments from governments or companies to convince many additional farmers to take up the practice. “If this is an imperative, then somebody is going to have to pay for it,” he said. Joe McClure, Iowa Soybean Association research director, said the Stanford study largely confirms his organization's research, though he thought the university researchers should do field study to verify their satellite-based analysis. McClure said more more financial support would help farmers avoid having to choose between planting cover crops and losing money. J. Arbuckle, a professor in Iowa State University's sustainable agriculture program, said it's important to be open with farmers about possible yield reductions and how they can be mitigated over longer periods, such as six or seven years. Even then, Arbuckle said, it can be hard to convince farmers to give cover crops a try because, despite the significant environmental benefits, a small drop in cash crop yield can mean a big cost. “Even a one bushel hit, if you're talking about a bushel an acre over a thousand acres, that's a lot of money,"" he said. ___ This story has been updated to correct the name of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

And Lara Bryant, the group's deputy director of water and agriculture, notes that while the overall percentage of farmers planting cover crops is small, acreage increased by 50% to about 5% of U.S. cropland from 2012 to 2017, the most recent year USDA data is available. “We have a long way to go but we’ve come a long way in a short amount of time,” Bryant said. However, the 2022 satellite study found yields declined by an average of 5.5% on corn fields where cover crops were used for three or more years. For soybean fields, the decline was 3.5%. The declines varied depending on factors such as cover crop type, soil moisture and soil quality. “I was surprised it was so negative,” said David Lobell, a Stanford University agricultural ecologist who worked on the study published in the journal Global Change Biology with researchers from Illinois and North Carolina. “We rechecked everything and were a little bit surprised.” The study found that rye, the most frequently used cover crop, is especially prone to reducing yields, Lobell said. Rye is less expensive than many cover crops and grows well in many kinds of soil. The study examined farm fields in Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio, using satellite images. Lobell said details from an individual field are less precise than on-the-ground study, but by examining thousands of fields, researchers can reach accurate conclusions. The researchers said farmers need more technical help choosing and maintaining cover crops as well as more government or food industry payments to offset potential yield losses. The federal government and at least 22 states provide financial incentives to farmers — and food companies such as General Mills and PepsiCo pay more to farmers who plant cover crops. Terry Cosby, chief of the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service, acknowledged establishing effective cover crops can take time and some experimenting but said farmers who stick with them should see significant benefits. He noted the Biden administration's allocation of $19.5 billion for climate smart programs over five years and that federal, state and university outreach services can provide technical advice. “It's going to take some trials and errors,"" Cosby said. ""It might fail but over the long term ... it has been proven that you can be very successful with some type of cover crop.” Downs, the Illinois farmer, has tried to incorporate cover crops into some of his operations, especially to control weeds. But he says it hasn’t been easy. In 2019, Downs planted rye in one field but didn’t plant it on an identical field across a road. The spring was wet and the rye field was so soggy, he couldn't get in for weeks to kill the cover crop and plant his soybeans, resulting in a smaller crop. “Growing a cover crop cost me $250 an acre, and I spent $50 an acre doing it,” Downs said. Farmers don't typically harvest and sell cover crops; they frequently use herbicides to kill them before planting their principle crop. Less than 20 miles (32 kilometers) away, fourth-generation farmer Curt Elmore has been “dabbling” in cover crops for a decade, planting varieties like oats and rye on parts of the 2,000 acres (809 hectares) he farms. Elmore seeds cover crops by plane before harvesting his cash crop, but cover crop growth has been spotty, not worth the $40-per-acre cost. Elmore said he’ll keep trying, but it seems that in his area of Illinois, it will take more payments from governments or companies to convince many additional farmers to take up the practice. “If this is an imperative, then somebody is going to have to pay for it,” he said. Joe McClure, Iowa Soybean Association research director, said the Stanford study largely confirms his organization's research, though he thought the university researchers should do field study to verify their satellite-based analysis. McClure said more more financial support would help farmers avoid having to choose between planting cover crops and losing money. J. Arbuckle, a professor in Iowa State University's sustainable agriculture program, said it's important to be open with farmers about possible yield reductions and how they can be mitigated over longer periods, such as six or seven years. Even then, Arbuckle said, it can be hard to convince farmers to give cover crops a try because, despite the significant environmental benefits, a small drop in cash crop yield can mean a big cost. “Even a one bushel hit, if you're talking about a bushel an acre over a thousand acres, that's a lot of money,"" he said. ___ This story has been updated to correct the name of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Democracy declined around the world for the sixth consecutive year in 2022 as half the world’s countries slid backwards on indicators such as freedom of expression and political participation, according to a prominent think tank. In its annual report released this week, the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) said 85 out of 173 countries surveyed had “suffered a decline in at least one key indicator of democratic performance in the past five years”. “In short, democracy is still in trouble, stagnant at best, and declining in many places,” IDEA Secretary-General Kevin Casas-Zamora said in its Global State of Democracy 2023 report. The six-year fall is the longest period of democratic backsliding since records began in 1975. Casas-Zamora attributed the decline to the global weakening of democratic institutions that otherwise help safeguard human rights and the rule of law. “But while many of our formal institutions like legislatures are weakening, there is hope that these more informal checks and balances, from journalists to election organizers and anti-corruption commissioners, can successfully battle authoritarian and populist trends,” he said in the report. The year 2022 was also challenged byRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, COVID-19, climate change, and thecost of living crisisthat accompanied rising inflation and a global economic downturn after the pandemic. Europe was named as the highest performing region in democratic terms, but also the scene of backsliding in younger democracies such as Hungary, but also in long-established ones including theUnited Kingdom. In eastern Europe and Asia, countries such as Azerbaijan, Belarus, Russia and Turkey scored poorly. In the Americas, the United States moved backwards due to “declines in social group equality”, as did Guatemala and El Salvador, which both saw widespread political turmoil and human rights violations in 2022.

The problem is not a shortage of milk itself, but the cardboard cartons used to package and serve it, according to dairy industry suppliers and state officials. Pactiv Evergreen of Lake Forest, Illinois, which bills itself as “the leading manufacturer of freshfoodand beverage packaging in North America” acknowledged in a statement Friday that it “continues to face significantly higher than projected demand” for its milk cartons. The shortage is affecting the company’s ability to “fully supply some school milk orders,” according to Matt Herrick, spokesperson for the International Dairy Foods Association. School officials in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Washington state said they were preparing for the shortage, while the U.S. Department of Agriculture acknowledged that the supply chain problem affects “multiple states.” In California, state education officials told schools to be flexible with how they offer milk to kids, including limiting milk choices; using boxed, shelf-stable milk; and providing milk using bulk dispensers. The carton shortage — which could also affect milk and juice served in hospitals, nursing homes and prisons — has forced officials across the country to brainstorm backup plans. In Clarence, New York, local school district officials told parents they plan to provide “small bottles of water or cups of milk with lids” if the cartons run out. In Lake Stevens, Washington, 40 miles (64 kilometers) from Seattle, chocolate milk was missing from this week’s dairy delivery, said Jayme Taylor, director of communications for the local school district. “That’s the only complaint we received from students,” she said in an email. Milk is required to be served with school meals, but officials with the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service issued a memo late last month allowing districts to serve different types or sizes of milk during the supply shortage — or to skip milk altogether. It’s not clear how long the carton shortage could last. In Everett, Washington, school officials told parents to expect a disruption in cafeteria milk supply that could “range up to several months.” Herrick said U.S. milk processors are working with other package suppliers to resolve the shortage. He said he expected the problem to improve within weeks and to be resolved by early next year. __ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Advocates fear a predetermined outcome that will remove the beloved animals from Theodore Roosevelt National Park. An extended public comment period ends Friday on the recent environmental assessment of the park’s three proposals: reduce the horse population quickly, reduce it gradually or take no immediate action. The horses have some powerful allies — including North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and U.S. Sen. John Hoeven — while advocates are pulling out all the stops to see that the animals stay. Park officials say they want to hear from the public. The horses are popular with park visitors, who often see and photograph them along the park's scenic road and hiking trails through the rugged Badlands. Evaluating whether the horses belong in the park has “been a long time in coming, and it realigns us with our overarching policies to remove non-native species from parks whenever they pose a potential risk to resources,” said Jenny Powers, a wildlife veterinarian who leads the wildlife health program for the National Park Service. “This isn't an easy decision for us, but it is one that is directly called for by our mission and mandates,” she told The Associated Press last month. One of the horses’ biggest advocates fears park officials have already decided to oust the horses. Chasing Horses Wild Horse Advocates President Chris Kman cites several alternatives for keeping horses that park officials considered but dismissed in the recent environmental assessment. In the document, the Park Service said those alternatives wouldn’t be “in alignment with NPS priorities to maintain the native prairie ecosystem” and wouldn’t address the animals’ impacts, among its reasons. Kman said she is “optimistic that we will ultimately win this fight. I don’t have any faith that the park will do the right thing and keep the horses in the park.” Even if the horses ultimately stay, Park Superintendent Angie Richman said they would have to be reduced to 35-60 animals under a 1978 environmental assessment. The ongoing process is part of the park's proposed management plan for “livestock,” a term the horses' allies reject. Wild horses were accidentally fenced into the park in its early years. They were eventually kept as a historic demonstration herd after years of efforts to eradicate them, according to Castle McLaughlin, who researched the horses' history in the 1980s as a graduate student working for the Park Service in North Dakota. Wild horse advocates would like the park to conduct a greater environmental review, and want to ultimately see a genetically viable herd of at least 150 horses maintained. A vast majority of previous public comments opposed removal of the horses, making it ""really difficult to understand why the government would choose to take them away from the American people,” said Grace Kuhn, communications director for the American Wild Horse Campaign. The wild horses “have a right to be in the national park” and align with Roosevelt's sentiment to preserve cultural resources for future generations, she said. “Essentially, the Park Service by implementing a plan to either eradicate them quickly or eradicate them slowly, they're thumbing their noses at the American public and their mission,” Kuhn said last month. Burgum in January offered state collaboration for keeping the horses in the park. His office and park officials have discussed options for the horses. State management or assistance in managing the horses in the park are options North Dakota would consider; relocation is not, spokesperson for the governor's office Mike Nowatzki said Monday.

With just over a day to spare, the United States averted yet another government shutdown on Thursday night, as President Joe Biden signed a last-minute bill to keep federal agencies funded through the new year. The bill was hailed as a bipartisan success — and as a key victory for newly minted House SpeakerMike Johnson, who was elected to the role only three weeks ago. But analysts say this short-term win might spell long-term trouble for Johnson, as he leads a fractured Republican caucus in the House of Representatives. “Some people believe that Johnson’s success in passing the continuing resolution indicates that the far right in the GOP will go along with the new speaker,” said Richard F Bensel, a government professor at Cornell University. “I read the event differently, because Johnson has deeply offended those far-right members, and they will now make life very difficult for him and the rest of the Republican Party.” Government spendingis a perennially divisive issue in the US Congress, with many Republicans pushing for greater budget cuts and Democrats often seeking to protect or expand social programmes. But when the two parties fail to pass budget legislation, the government risks shuttering all its non-essential functions. That leaves government services in limbo and employees and contractors without pay, potentially harming the country’s overall economic growth. Republicans and Democrats had set November 17 as their next deadline to pass new funding legislation. Faced with the prospect of an imminent shutdown, Johnson offered an unusual proposal: a two-step stopgap bill — or “continuing resolution” — that would allow government services to continue temporarily at current spending levels. But the catch was that Congress would have to revisit the budget question twice in the new year. Funding for veterans services, housing, agriculture and energy would need to be voted on before January 19, and the remainder of the budget would have to be decided by February 2. Nevertheless, Johnson’s bill proved to be a successful compromise. Itpassed the Houseon Tuesday with a vote of 336 to 95, thanks to the almost unanimous support from the Democrats. It also sailed through the Democrat-controlled Senate, allowing Biden to sign it into law late on Thursday. Johnson framed the bill’s passage as “a gift to the American people”, sparing the country any economic uncertainty and legislative deadlock. “It’s going to change the way we’ve done this,” Johnson said of his two-step solution. “We have broken the fever.” But the bill failed to wrest major concessions from the Democrats, including the significant budget cuts that the far right had called for. As a result, a total of 93 House Republicans voted against the continuing resolution, breaking ranks with Johnson. “If we were keeping score — and, of course, everyone in Washington does — this is a clear win for the Democrats. Given the divided government, the Democrats would prefer such a continuing resolution all the way to February 2025,” Bensel, the Cornell University professor, said. Among the Republican opposition was a group of about 30 self-proclaimed fiscal conservatives known as theFreedom Caucus. One of the caucus’sleaders, Representative Chip Roy, slammed the bill as a “strategic failure” and “mistake” that Johnson committed “right out of the gate”. “When are we going to do what we said we would do?” Roy asked on the House floor. “When are we going to stand to thwart and stop the reckless spending?” Critics have noted that the Freedom Caucus is often a disruptive presence in Congress, one that considers members of the Democratic Party as “enemies” and “Marxists”. Cooperation, therefore, is not an option. Nicholas F Jacobs, a government professor at Colby College, said that scuttling bills like the budget resolution can actually pay political dividends for members of the Freedom Caucus. “What makes them different is that they do not feel the same electoral pressures when the government shuts down as does every other member of Congress, Republican or Democrat,” Jacobs said. In fact, he added, hardline tactics — even risking a government shutdown — can actually appeal to their far-right base. “They can still score points when they go on Twitter or Fox, claiming they’re doing everything possible to cut the national debt.” Though Johnson may have angered the Freedom Caucus, he retains his reputation as a far-right Republican himself. Jacobs warned that the bipartisan success of Johnson’s funding bill should not be seen as a shift to the centre for either Republicans or Democrats. “I don’t think we can expect to see any pragmatic turn soon,” Jacobs said. “Democrats relish the fact that Republicans can’t govern at the moment.” Bensel likewise cast doubt over whether the bipartisan spending bill signals an embrace of political pragmatism in Congress. Rather, Johnson is seen as part of a continuing shift rightward for the Republican Party. Formerly a little-known representative from Louisiana, Johnson is considered a loyal supporter of formerPresident Donald Trumpand a key figure behind the effort tosubvert the 2020 election, which Trump lost. “On social and cultural issues, Johnson is even more of an abomination for Democrats than is Donald Trump, which will complicate pragmatic politics,” Bensel said. Bensel also noted Johnson’s prominent embrace of the Christian right. In his first interview as speaker, Johnson told TV host Sean Hannity that his worldview was shaped by the Bible. “His evangelical Christian beliefs place him at the fringe of the GOP, a party that is otherwise known for its religious commitments,” Bensel said. “Johnson’s devout beliefs may, in the end, trip him up if he is forced to choose between them and more pragmatic politics.” Regardless of Johnson’s political and religious leanings, Bensel questions whether any Republican speaker can keep ahold of the gavel in thebitterly divided House. Just a month and a half ago, on October 3, far-right members of the party led asuccessful effortto overthrow Johnson’s predecessor,former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, after he also agreed to a bipartisan budget compromise. McCarthy had only been speaker for nine months. “It may be that no Republican can survive very long as speaker in the current House,” Bensel said. But Bensel and other analysts acknowledged there were key differences between McCarthy and Johnson that may shape their respective fates as party leaders. Robert Y Shapiro, a government professor at Columbia University, told Al Jazeera that McCarthy was not seen as a stalwart enough supporter of the far right. “He was not enough of a backer of all matters related to Trump and vigorously denying the election,” Shapiro explained. “He was not a visible backer of the Freedom Caucus and right-wing rhetoric and craziness, and was seen as more willing to work with Democrats.” He added that Johnson’s dark-horse status as a speaker candidate proved to be an advantage. “Johnson, meanwhile, was not well known, so without McCarthy’s baggage, and he has been a strong supporter of Trump — and a fellow election denier,” Shapiro said. McCarthy’s removal as speaker in October triggered aprolonged searchfor a replacement, one that shone a spotlight on the disarray in the Republican Party. It took three weeks of party in-fighting and multiple votes for Johnson toemerge victorious. Shapiro said the Republicans are likely looking to project an image of stability moving forward — and that will help protect Johnson’s position as speaker, at least over the short term. “They also will not boot him since Republicans in the House realise how bad booting him and another battle for Speaker would look,” he said. Moreover, with the2024 presidential electionlooming, Shapiro believes that the rift within the Republican Party has an expiration date. “In the end, the 2024 election, those divisions will disappear in terms of virtually all Republican members of Congress and the Senate supporting Trump or whoever the GOP nominee is.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","Far-right members of the Republican caucus have opposed the bipartisan budget bill, which averted a government shutdown. With just over a day to spare, the United States averted yet another government shutdown on Thursday night, as President Joe Biden signed a last-minute bill to keep federal agencies funded through the new year. The bill was hailed as a bipartisan success — and as a key victory for newly minted House SpeakerMike Johnson, who was elected to the role only three weeks ago. But analysts say this short-term win might spell long-term trouble for Johnson, as he leads a fractured Republican caucus in the House of Representatives. “Some people believe that Johnson’s success in passing the continuing resolution indicates that the far right in the GOP will go along with the new speaker,” said Richard F Bensel, a government professor at Cornell University. “I read the event differently, because Johnson has deeply offended those far-right members, and they will now make life very difficult for him and the rest of the Republican Party.” Government spendingis a perennially divisive issue in the US Congress, with many Republicans pushing for greater budget cuts and Democrats often seeking to protect or expand social programmes. But when the two parties fail to pass budget legislation, the government risks shuttering all its non-essential functions. That leaves government services in limbo and employees and contractors without pay, potentially harming the country’s overall economic growth. Republicans and Democrats had set November 17 as their next deadline to pass new funding legislation. Faced with the prospect of an imminent shutdown, Johnson offered an unusual proposal: a two-step stopgap bill — or “continuing resolution” — that would allow government services to continue temporarily at current spending levels. But the catch was that Congress would have to revisit the budget question twice in the new year. Funding for veterans services, housing, agriculture and energy would need to be voted on before January 19, and the remainder of the budget would have to be decided by February 2. Nevertheless, Johnson’s bill proved to be a successful compromise. Itpassed the Houseon Tuesday with a vote of 336 to 95, thanks to the almost unanimous support from the Democrats. It also sailed through the Democrat-controlled Senate, allowing Biden to sign it into law late on Thursday. Johnson framed the bill’s passage as “a gift to the American people”, sparing the country any economic uncertainty and legislative deadlock. “It’s going to change the way we’ve done this,” Johnson said of his two-step solution. “We have broken the fever.” But the bill failed to wrest major concessions from the Democrats, including the significant budget cuts that the far right had called for. As a result, a total of 93 House Republicans voted against the continuing resolution, breaking ranks with Johnson. “If we were keeping score — and, of course, everyone in Washington does — this is a clear win for the Democrats. Given the divided government, the Democrats would prefer such a continuing resolution all the way to February 2025,” Bensel, the Cornell University professor, said. Among the Republican opposition was a group of about 30 self-proclaimed fiscal conservatives known as theFreedom Caucus. One of the caucus’sleaders, Representative Chip Roy, slammed the bill as a “strategic failure” and “mistake” that Johnson committed “right out of the gate”. “When are we going to do what we said we would do?” Roy asked on the House floor. “When are we going to stand to thwart and stop the reckless spending?” Critics have noted that the Freedom Caucus is often a disruptive presence in Congress, one that considers members of the Democratic Party as “enemies” and “Marxists”.

Israeli forces are also tightening movement restrictions and carrying out mass arrests of Palestinians in the area. Al Jazeera correspondent Mohammed Jamjoom, reporting from Ramallah, said raids have escalated significantly in the occupied West Bank in the past week. “The raids have gotten to up to about 40 per day,” Jamjoom said. “That’s a huge increase from where they were earlier in the year, throughout 2023, when they had become an almost daily occurrence.”      In addition to the raids, West Bank residents are also facing heightened violence from armed Israeli settlers. Settlers have killed at least eight Palestinians and forced hundreds out of their homes since October 7, according to Palestinian officials. “Now [the settlers] are a bit more emboldened by the fact that there’s a war [going on],” Adam Bouloukos, director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) affairs in the West Bank, told Al Jazeera. “And their violence is much more considerable and much more lethal.” Israel has promised to eliminate Hamas in response to its October 7 attacks in the south, which killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials.

Turkey has launched a rescue mission to hunt for 11 missing sailors after deadly storms sank a cargo vessel, killing one. The ship sank in the Black Sea amid a burst of stormy weather, killing at least one sailor and leaving the remaining 11 crew members missing, Turkey’s interior minister said on Monday. The weather front that wrecked the vessel killed at least nine people, including the sailor, over the weekend in Turkey. The Kafkametler cargo ship went down with 12 crew members on board after hitting a seawall 120km (75 miles) east of Istanbul, Turkey’s Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said. Turkish rescuers, initially held back by the poor weather, on Monday scanned the waters by helicopter in search of the missing sailors. They have recovered the body of one sailor and are continuing to scour the area for those still lost, Yerlikaya said. The Turkish-flagged ship was transporting ferrosilicon – an alloy used in steelmaking – from the Russian port of Temryuk to Aliaga in Turkey. The storms that broke out in northwestern Turkey caused havoc over the weekend, destroying another cargo ship, forcing the evacuation of a prison, and killing at least nine people. A Cameroon-flagged vessel split into two due to the treacherous conditions after weathering 5-metre (16-foot) waves near the coastal city of Eregli, the Maritime General Directorate said. All 13 crew members were rescued. At Eregli’s prison, rising water levels pushed authorities to transfer inmates to surrounding facilities, Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said. Storms and flooding meanwhile killed at least four people in the southeastern province of Batman, three people in the northern province of Zonguldak and another person in southeastern Diyarbakir, Yerlikaya said. The turbulent weather followed an especially dry summer that brought Istanbul’s dams to their lowest levels in nine years.

After Hamas launched an assault in Israel on October 7, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varakdar decried the deadly incursion, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 240 were taken captive. But less than a week later, he became one of the few European officials to raise alarm. “Israel doesn’t have the right to do wrong,” he said in something of a play on words as most European leaders were stressing Israel’s “right” to self-defence during its bombing campaign on Gaza, the enclave ruled by Hamas. In just 41 days of war, more than 11,400 Palestinians have been killed by Israel. Varadkar has also said Israel’s bombardment “amounts to collective punishment”, which is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions. Michael D Higgins, the 82-year-old Irish president whose role is largely ceremonial, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was “notspeakingfor Ireland” when she expressed unconditional support for Israel on October 16 without acknowledging the ongoing occupation of Palestinian lands. After Israel began striking Gaza, Ireland, a member of the European Union, was one of the first countries to call for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” to meet the “urgent” needs of civilians. Niamh Nichillin – a 50-year-old primary school teacher in Tipperary and a member of Fianna Fail, one of two governing centre-right parties – is among the many in Ireland who sympathise with the people of Gaza, one of the world’s most densely populated areas often described as an open-air prison due to Israel’s blockade of the enclave. “Israeli air strikes on Gaza are clearly disproportionate towards a civilian population with little or no defences,” she told Al Jazeera. “This can hardly be called a war in the usual sense of the word.” Statements by Israeli officials indicate they are motivated by a “desire for the destruction of Gaza”, she said. “This is unacceptable.” On October 18, Ireland announced an additional 13 million-euro ($14m) package of humanitarian funding for Palestinians, lifting the 2023 total to 29 million euros ($31.5m) with the foreign ministry saying it was aware the unfolding situation in Gaza is a “humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented magnitude”. “I would like the Irish people to continue to use their influence to ensure that there is a ceasefire, an end to the siege and that enough humanitarian aid is getting through,” said Nichillin, who welcomed the news of extra aid. In 1980, Ireland was the first EU country to call for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Thirteen years later, it became the last member of the bloc to open an Israeli embassy in Dublin. In 2018, Ireland drew worldwide attention when independent politician Frances Black proposed the Occupied Territories Bill, which would have banned and criminalised trading goods and services from lands occupied by Israel. Although it enjoyed support across the political spectrum and the public, it was removed from the government’s programme during coalition negotiations in 2020 between the two ruling parties, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. In 2021, Ireland became the first EU country to declare that Israel was involved in the “de-facto annexation” of Palestinian land, upsetting Israel’s foreign ministry, which said the move “constitutes a victory for extremist Palestinian factions”. “Ireland’s own history of colonisation by the British has made many Irish people empathetic towards other nations under occupation or colonisation,” said Cathal O’hEanna, a representative of the left-wing nationalist party Sinn Fein. “Our centuries-long struggle for the right to self-determination resonates with the Palestinian struggle for statehood and independence,” he told Al Jazeera. John Lyndon, executive director of the Alliance for Middle East Peace, said, “At first there was Irish solidarity with Jews in Mandate Palestine and then early Israel because they were seen as fighting British colonialism, using some of the same paramilitary tactics as the IRA. And some also had an affinity with the kibbutz movement and the socialist ideals of early Israel.” “However, after Israel started expanding settlements on Palestinian territory following the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Irish allegiance switched towards the Palestinian cause,” he added. Today, as the war escalates, pro-Palestine protests continue throughout the country. On Wednesday evening, more than 1,000 people rallied outside the lower house in Dublin as a motion to expel Israeli Ambassador Dana Erlich, who has accused Higgins of “spreading misinformation” about the Israel-Hamas war, was being voted on. The motion – which was put forward by the Social Democrats and supported by Sinn Fein and the Trotskyist People before Profit party – was defeated. Another motion tabled by Sinn Fein calling on Ireland to refer Israel to the International Criminal Court was also defeated. Celebrated Irish writers are also organising. Authors including Sally Rooney, Sinead Gleeson, Donal Ryan and Colin Barrett are participating in four Irish Writers for Palestine events from November 28. “Writers, especially in Ireland, occupy a certain cultural position, and we hope to use that position to do what we can to show our solidarity,” said Michael Magee, one of the organisers. “Voices sympathetic to the Palestinian struggle, both within Israel and across Europe and the US, are facing more marginalisation and violent suppression than ever.” Lyndon said that although he understands his fellow citizens, he feels that it is “important to be careful” about how solidarity with the Palestinian cause is expressed. “The [October 7 attacks] triggered memories of the Holocaust for the Israeli side while the Palestinians now feel that they are reliving the Nakba. I’d like to see more solidarity with Palestinians and Israelis working together to end the occupation and ensure self-determination for each rather than one side fighting the other.” Lyndon tragically lost a friend, the longtime advocate for Palestinian rightsVivian Silver, in the Hamas attacks.

Rest in power, Vivian 💔pic.twitter.com/Qv1IkYX0dT — John Lyndon (@JohnLyndon_)November 13, 2023  Ireland should position itself as a peace negotiator, he said, because it has its “own history with conflict resolution” through its efforts to bring about the Good Friday Agreement. That Ireland “does not have the same ‘colonial baggage’ as other EU countries” would reassure Palestinians if the country were present in any negotiations. “Ireland’s relationship with the US is also very good, so I would like to see Ireland use those strengths to play a better diplomatic role [in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict],” said Lyndon. While Irish citizens of the Republic of Ireland overwhelmingly support the Palestinian cause, the picture is different in Northern Ireland, where people endured 30 years of violence known as the Troubles between nationalists and unionists. That conflict largely came to an end with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Opinions on the Middle East are divided along sectarian lines to a degree with Palestinian flags a common feature in the nationalist neighbourhoods of Belfast and Israeli flags in the unionist areas. While these flags have long flown, more have appeared since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Amr Hashad, an activist in Belfast, said he sees similarities between the nationalist struggle in Northern Ireland for independence from the UK, which led to the emergence of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (Provos) in 1969 following widespread violence against the Catholic community, and Hamas, which was founded in 1987 at the start of the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising. However, after the Provos launched an attack in London in 1995, “the British government and the EU negotiated with this army and even asked US President Bill Clinton for help in doing so until they managed to find a solution to the conflict”, Hashad said. “Today, we find ourselves in a similar situation to the Provos’ secret attack on London where Hamas attacked Israel and the entire Gaza Strip is being punished mercilessly as innocent women, children and the elderly are killed with the support of the West. The question I ask myself is: Why aren’t the West negotiating with Hamas like it did with the Provos?” Soon after the October 7 attacks, Sinn Fein, in contrast with statements made by other Western governments and political parties, said that while it had “no plans to meet or engage” with Hamas, it would “not rule out meeting with or talking to anybody” as part of efforts to secure peace in the Middle East. Ireland is not among the small minority of EU countries that officially recognises Palestine and, in line with the bloc’s position, considers Hamas a terrorist organisation. The Irish parliament put forward a motion in 2014, calling on the government to formally recognise its statehood, but the push remains in limbo. Michael Martin, foreign minister, said in September that the government was preparing to recognise Palestine as an independent state. Andrew Cottey, a professor at the University College Cork’s department of government and politics, said that despite the political and public support of Palestine, “whatever the rights or wrongs of recognising Palestine, it would put Ireland in a minority within the European Union” and “significantly at odds with the United States on this issue”. “You can make an argument for recognising Palestine, but were Ireland to do that, would it have any substantive impact on the situation on the ground in Israel and Palestine? Probably not. And the kind of political cost for the Irish government would be to antagonise the United States and isolate itself within the European Union.” Stephanie Nic Carthaig, a translator who believes Ireland should officially recognise Palestine, said she understands Cottey’s argument, but added: “Neoliberalism in Irish politics, servile attitudes to empire and influence from the US are behind this slowness to recognise Palestine.” Irish composer Raymond Deane, co-founder of the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign, criticised his country’s position on numerous fronts. “Ireland should disassociate itself from EU policy [on Israel and Palestine] from dealing exclusively with the Palestinian Authority, which has no real authority, and cease to repeat the ‘two-state solution’ ad nauseam,” he told Al Jazeera. He would also like to see Ireland put an arms embargo on Israel and witness the Occupied Territories Bill implemented. While the Irish government has gone further in its condemnation of Israel than other EU countries, Nichillin, Deane and Nic Carthaig are not alone in wanting the Irish government to do more. Mary Lou McDonald, president of Sinn Fein, has said recognising Palestinian statehood would top the foreign policy agenda should her party lead the government. Sinn Fein met with ambassadors from Arab countries this month to discuss Gaza and the need for “dialogue” to secure a just and lasting peace, including a “viable state of Palestine”.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo has pressed his United States counterpart Joe Biden to do more to end “atrocities” in Gaza and help bring about a ceasefire. The two leaders’ talks on Monday were overshadowed by the month-long Israel-Hamas war in which the US has given Israel its full support. Widodo, who is popularly known as Jokowi, attended a joint summit of Arab and Muslim leaders in Riyadh at the weekend which condemned Israel and called for a ceasefire. Indonesia is the world’s most populous Muslim country and has seen large protests in support of the Palestinians as well as aboycott of businessesseen as linked to Israel. “Indonesia appeals to the US to do more to stop the atrocities in Gaza,” Widodo said in the Oval Office as the two presidents met in the White House in front of a roaring fire. “A ceasefire is a must for the sake of humanity.” Violence erupted on October 7 after the armed group Hamas, which controls Gaza, launched a surprise assault on Israel killing about 1,200 people and takingmore than 200 captive. In response Israel imposed atotal blockadeon Gaza and has been bombarding the Gaza Strip ever since, killing at least 11,000 Palestinians. US officials have said Biden is keen for Indonesia to “play a larger role” in the Middle East, which could include the “ceasefire issue” but also long-term goals such as a two-state solution after the war and rebuilding Gaza. While Washington has thrown its full support behind Israel, it has more recently begun calling for more restraint and “pauses” in the fighting that would allow the delivery of humanitarian aid or the release of the captives held by Hamas. The Jokowi-Biden meeting comes ahead of talks between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, as well as a key summit of leaders from APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation), which is taking place in San Francisco. China and Indonesia are both members of APEC. The US aims to upgrade cooperation with Indonesia to a so-called comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest diplomatic level, as it deepens alliances in the Asia Pacific region. Biden unveiled a similar upgrade to ties with Vietnam on a visit to Hanoi in September. “This will mark a new era of relations between the United States and Indonesia across the board, affecting everything,” Biden said as he sat next to Jokowi. The deepening crisis in Myanmar was also up for discussion. The country was plunged into turmoil in February 2021, when the military seized power from the government of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Fighting between the military and armed groups fighting against the coup has intensified in the past couple of weeks.

Biden and Jokowi’s talks also covered new cooperation in areas of defence such as cybersecurity, and space as well as climate with the US due to announce steps with the Southeast Asian country on carbon capture and storage, supporting the electricity grid and improving air quality. Amid rising geopolitical tension, Jokowi was keen to stress Indonesia’s long-held neutrality. “Indonesia is always open to cooperate with any country, and not to take the side of any power, except to take the side of peace and humanity,” he said.

Islamabad, Pakistan– A court in Pakistan has asked the authorities to present jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan before it next week for trial in a case related to the alleged leaking of state secrets. The special court established under the Official Secrets Act in capital Islamabad on Thursday said Khan and former Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, also in jail, should be produced in court on November 28. It will be Khan’sfirst public appearancesince he was imprisoned in August in another case related to the illegal selling of state gifts he received from foreign leaders and governments during his tenure as prime minister from 2018 to 2022. “We now have to see that this [court] order is implemented,” Khan’s lawyer, Naeem Panjutha, said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Thursday.      Khan, 71, was removed as prime minister after he lost a no-confidence vote in parliament in April 2022 – a move he blamed on a conspiracy hatched by the United States in collusion with his political opponents and the powerful military. The former cricket star claimed a diplomatic cable, or cypher, sent by the then Pakistani ambassador to the US proved his allegations. Both Washington and Islamabad have rejected the charges. In dozens of mass rallies Khan held following his removal, he attacked his successor, Shehbaz Sharif, and the military for plotting to remove him, triggering mass protests by the members and supporters of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. As the government cracked down on protests, which sometimes turned deadly, dozens of cases, some containing serious charges including terrorism, murder and sedition, were filed against Khan and other leaders of his party. Pakistani authorities also accused Khan of leaking the contents of the diplomatic cypher for political gains and arrested Qureshi as well in the same case. On August 5, Khan was imprisoned for three years in the state gifts case. Though a court granted him bail on August 29, he remained in custody as the trial in the cypher case continued inside the jail. However, on Tuesday, the Islamabad High Courtdeclared his trial in jail illegaland all the proceedings in the case so far, including an indictment last month, as “null and void”. Khan’s legal troubles mount as Pakistan heads towards a crucial general election in which his PTI party is expected to make huge gains, even though the PTI chief’s conviction bars him from contesting.

The former cricket star claimed a diplomatic cable, or cypher, sent by the then Pakistani ambassador to the US proved his allegations. Both Washington and Islamabad have rejected the charges. In dozens of mass rallies Khan held following his removal, he attacked his successor, Shehbaz Sharif, and the military for plotting to remove him, triggering mass protests by the members and supporters of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. As the government cracked down on protests, which sometimes turned deadly, dozens of cases, some containing serious charges including terrorism, murder and sedition, were filed against Khan and other leaders of his party. Pakistani authorities also accused Khan of leaking the contents of the diplomatic cypher for political gains and arrested Qureshi as well in the same case. On August 5, Khan was imprisoned for three years in the state gifts case. Though a court granted him bail on August 29, he remained in custody as the trial in the cypher case continued inside the jail. However, on Tuesday, the Islamabad High Courtdeclared his trial in jail illegaland all the proceedings in the case so far, including an indictment last month, as “null and void”. Khan’s legal troubles mount as Pakistan heads towards a crucial general election in which his PTI party is expected to make huge gains, even though the PTI chief’s conviction bars him from contesting.

Rishi Sunak met his new cabinet after a dramatic overhaul on Monday saw the former prime minister return to front-line politics. He replaces James Cleverly, who was moved to be home secretary to take over from Suella Braverman. Mrs Braverman was sacked following her criticism of the Metropolitan Police. Greeting his new set of ministers, the prime minister said: ""A warm welcome to those for whom it's their first cabinet and also a welcome to those for whom it may not be their first time."" He added that it would be ""an important week"" ahead with new inflation figures and the court's decision on the government's Rwanda policy expected on Wednesday.  Lord Cameron, as he is now known as of his appointment to the House of Lords on Monday, had been out of Parliament since he stood down as prime minister in 2016. His return to politics came out of the blue, with Downing Street managing to prevent any rumours of the appointment from leaking, despite the fact the job offer was made last week.  In one fell swoop, No 10 revealed not only was the former prime minister entering the House of Lords, he would also be taking up one of the most senior jobs in government. While the news was still being digested in Westminster, Lord Cameron was carrying out official duties, including holding a call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The pair ""reiterated the strength and depth of the relationship between the UK and the US"", the Foreign Office said, and spoke about the war in Ukraine. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: ""They discussed the conflict in the Middle East, Israel's right to self defence and the need for humanitarian pauses to allow the safe passage of aid into Gaza."" In a speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet in London on Monday night, Mr Sunak said he was ""pleased to have appointed a new foreign secretary"" and said the new cabinet is ""a united team"".  Richard Holden, the newly-appointed Conservative Party chair, told BBC Breakfast that Lord Cameron had returned ""out of a sense of duty"" and would bring experience to the role. But not everyone in the Conservative Party is pleased about the return of Lord Cameron and the new-look cabinet.  One backbencher, Dame Andrea Jenkyns, has already submitted a letter of no confidence in the prime minister, citing the sacking of Mrs Braverman. There would need to be 53 before his leadership is threatened.  And Conservative former cabinet minister Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Tories were ""in danger of losing votes to the Reform party"". Reform leader Richard Tice was ""as happy as can be"" when he saw him earlier, he told BBC Newsnight, adding: ""The champagne will be flowing in the Reform party headquarters tonight after what's been done today."" Opposition parties have been quick to ask whether bringing back a prime minister who left office seven years ago is really the fresh start Mr Sunak claims to offer. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said voters would be ""wondering how David Cameron coming back into government will help them pay for their weekly shop"". She added that the Conservatives were ""out of ideas"" and could not offer ""the change our country is crying out for"".  Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said it ""sounds like desperation"".  The Lib Dems are also calling for Lord Cameron's peerage to be blocked, referring to his lobbying for collapsed finance company Greensill Capital. Lord Cameron said he had resigned from the various business and charitable roles - including president of the Alzheimer's Research UK - he had held since quitting as prime minister. ""I have one job - to be foreign secretary and work with the prime minister for the UK to be as secure and prosperous as possible in a difficult and dangerous world,"" he said. He insisted the Greensill affair was ""in the past"" and had been ""dealt with"". Opposition parties and Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle have raised concerns about how MPs will be able to hold Lord Cameron to account, since he will sit as a peer rather than in the Commons.

… [+8649 chars]",Politics,"COLUMBUS, Ohio --The statewide battles over abortion rights since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a constitutional right to abortion have exposed another fault line: the commitment to democracy. As voters in state after state affirm their support for abortion rights, opponents are acting with escalating defiance toward the democratic processes and institutions they perceive as aligned against their cause. Certain Republican elected officials and anti-abortion activists around the country have responded to losses at the ballot box by challengingelectionresults, refusing to bring state laws into line with voter-backed changes, moving to strip state courts of their power to consider abortion-related laws and challenging the citizen-led ballot initiative process itself. “We.Are.Not.Done.,” Ohio state Rep. Jennifer Gross declared on the social media platform X two days after voters enshrined the right to abortion in the state constitution earlier this month. She and 25 other Republican lawmakers vowed to block the amendment from reversing Ohio's existing abortion restrictions. A strong majority of Ohio voters passed the amendment, by roughly 57% to 43%. In response, the group of lawmakers said in a joint statement: ""We will do everything in our power to prevent our laws from being removed based upon perception of intent.” Gross joined three fellow Republicans to go even further, proposing legislation to prevent Ohio courts from interpreting any cases related to the abortion-rights amendment, known as Issue 1. Similar efforts have emerged in six other states since state courts became the new abortion battleground after the Dobbs decision on June 24, 2022, that overturned Roe v. Wade. Douglas Keith, senior counsel to the Brennan Center for Justice’s Judiciary Program, said abortion politics prompted successful efforts to limit the power of state courts in Montana and Utah and unsuccessful legislation in Alaska and Kansas. Such bills are attempts to dismantle the government's system of checks and balances, he said. “An attempt to strip the courts’ ability to interpret Issue 1 seems to me to be picking a fight with not just the courts, but with voters themselves,” Keith said in reference to the Ohio amendment. That conflict was on display during a town hall hosted by Gross after her efforts to thwart the abortion-rights amendment were announced. A constituent who said she supported Issue 1, Emily Jackson, was incredulous. “You’re ignoring the voice. The voice is there,"" Jackson said. ""We spoke.” Gross told Jackson she wasn't ignoring voters but rather was reflecting opponents' concerns that Ohio voters were led astray. The campaign drew big money from outside the state for both sides. Gross did not return call and emails seeking additional comment. Advocates contend that strict abortion laws also are undemocratic in the most basic sense because a majority of Americans oppose them. According to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 94,000 voters, 63% of those who voted in the 2022 midterm elections said abortion should be legal in most or all cases. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll taken a year after the Supreme Court's decision found that about two-thirds of Americans overall said abortion should generally be legal. In all seven states where abortion has been on the ballot since Roe v. Wade fell, voters have either supported protecting abortion rights or rejected an attempt to erode them. That has led some Republicans who support abortion restrictions to target the ballot initiative process, a form of direct democracy that is available to voters in only about half the states. “Thank goodness that most of the states in this country don’t allow you to put everything on the ballot because pure democracies are not the way to run a country,” said Rick Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania and one-time presidential candidate. He spoke about Ohio's election results during an appearance on the conservative site NewsMax. Another elected Republican, North Dakota state Rep. Brandon Prichard, weighed in on X, formerly Twitter, to encourage Republicans to defy the outcome of Ohio's election. ""It would be an act of courage to ignore the results of the election and not allow for the murder of Ohio babies,” he wrote. Some political observers see a larger danger in such sentiments. Sophia Jordán Wallace, a political science professor at the University of Washington, said “the frequency and the explicitness of these undemocratic attempts are increasing” and that they threaten to do long-term damage to American institutions and the public’s faith in them. “And that damage is incredibly difficult to undo,"" she said. For many abortion opponents, the issue is “a sacred cause, the thing that cannot be argued with,” one that may outweigh the importance of maintaining democratic practices, said Myrna Perez, associate professor of Gender and American Religion at Ohio University. ”Things aren’t static, so you’re trying to figure out a way to get the system to give you the results that you want,” she said. Andrew Whitehead, associate professor of sociology at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, said Christian nationalists, who have deep ties to the anti-abortion movement, have a history of viewing access to fundamental democratic processes such as voting not as a right but a privilege that should be afforded only to those who align with their beliefs. “When it comes to enforcing their vision for America they think is ordained by God, they will set aside democracy,” Whitehead said. Anti-abortion lawmakers and advocates already have pushed back in a handful of states where voters sided generally with abortion rights. In Montana, voters last fall rejected a legislative referendum that would have criminalized a doctor's or nurse's failure to provide lifesaving care to a baby born alive after an attempted abortion; such cases typically involve severe medical problems. Republicans countered by passing a version of the rejected measure into law. Kentucky Republicans chose to leave intact a state ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, even though voters there defeated a measure that would have denied constitutional protections for the procedure. In Ohio, some notable top Republicans are rejecting anti-democratic suggestions and standing up for voters. “In this country, we accept the results of elections,” said GOP Gov. Mike DeWine, a leading opponent of Issue 1. Republican Attorney General Dave Yost tweeted that he “scoured” the Ohio Constitution, but found “no exception for matters in which the outcome of an election is contrary to the preferences of those in power.” “All political power is inherent in the people,” he quoted the document as saying. Republican state legislative leaders initially pledged that the fight to restrict abortion rights wasn't over after voters had spoken. But as their party grapples with the anti-abortion movement's deep divisions, House Speaker Jason Stephens and Senate President Matt Huffman have appeared to soften their tone. Stephens signaled he won't advance Gross’s court-limiting bill. Huffman, a devout Catholic, walked back suggestions that he could pursue an immediate repeal of Issue 1. They were among Ohio Republicans who defied their own law and called a special election in August aimed at raising the threshold for passing future constitutional amendments from a simple majority to 60%. The measure was widely seen as an attempt to undermine the fall abortion amendment and was soundly rejected. The tensions already are evident for abortion initiatives planned for state ballots in 2024. In Missouri, disputes over ballot language are complicating efforts by abortion-rights supporters to advance a statewide ballot measure. A panel of judges last month ruled that summaries written by Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, an abortion opponent who is running for governor next year, were politically partisan and misleading. In Michigan, three Republican lawmakers joined an anti-abortion group in suing to overturn a state constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights that voters passed with wide support last year. Florida’s Republican attorney general is attempting to keep a proposed abortion rights amendment off the 2024 ballot. “We saw voters make that connection in Ohio between abortion and democracy in that first special election,” said Kara Gross, legislative director at the ACLU of Florida. “And we have faith voters will be able to make that same connection elsewhere in 2024.” ___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

To have an even money shot at keeping warming to the 1.5-degree Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) limit adopted by the 2015 Paris climate agreement, countries have to slash their emissions by 42% by the end of the decade, said the U.N. Environment Programme’s Emissions Gap report issued Monday. Carbon emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas rose 1.2% last year, the report said. This year Earth got a taste of what’s to come, said the report, which sets the table for international climate talks later this month. Through the end of September, the daily global average temperature exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius above mid-19th century levels on 86 days this year, the report said. But that increased to 127 days because nearly all of the first two weeks of November and all of October reached or exceeded 1.5 degrees, according to the European climate service Copernicus. That's 40% of the days so far this year. On Friday, the globe hit 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees) above pre-industrial levels for the first time in recorded history, according to Copernicus Deputy Director Samantha Burgess. “It’s really an indication that we are already seeing a change, an acceleration,” said report lead author Anne Olhoff of Denmark’s climate think tank Concito. “Based on what science tells us, this is just like a whisper. What will be in the future will be more like a roar.” It's dangerous already, said UNEP Director Inger Andersen. “Temperatures are hitting new heights, while extreme weather events are occurring more and more often, developing faster and becoming much more intense,” Andersen said. The new report “tells us that it's going to take a massive and urgent shift to avoid these records falling year after year.” The 1.5-degree goal is based on a time period measured over many years, not days, scientists said. Earlier reports put Earth reaching that longer term limit in early 2029 without dramatic emission changes. To keep that from happening, the countries of the world have to come up with more stringent goals to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and implement policies to act on those goals, Olhoff said. In the past two years only nine countries have come up with new goals, so that hasn’t moved the needle, but some countries, including the United States and those in Europe, have put policies in place that slightly improved the outlook, she said. The United States’ Inflation Reduction Act, which has $375 billion in spending on clean energy, by 2030 would reduce yearly emissions of carbon dioxide by about 1 billion metric tons, Olhoff said. That sounds like a lot, but the world in 2022 spewed 57.4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases. Current country pledges would trim that to 55 billion metric tons, and to limit warming to the 1.5 degree mark emissions in 2030 have to be down to 33 billion metric tons. That's an “emissions gap” of 22 billion metric tons. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said “the emissions gap is more like an emissions canyon — a canyon littered with broken promises, broken lives and broken records.” That’s why the report said the chance of keeping warming at or under 1.5 degrees is about one-in-seven or about 14%, “very, very slim indeed,” Olhoff said. If the world wants to settle for a warming limit of 2 degrees Celsius — a secondary threshold in the Paris agreement — it only has to trim emissions down to 41 billion metric tons, with a gap of 16 billion metric tons from now, the report said. Because the world has already warmed nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid-19th century, the report’s projections would mean another 1.3 to 1.7 degrees Celsius (2.3 to 3.1 degrees Fahrenheit) warming by the end of this century. For two years countries have known they have to come up with more ambitious emission cuts targets if the world wants to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, but “none of the large emitters have changed their pledges,” said study co-author Niklas Hohne, a scientist at the New Climate Institute in Germany. That’s why for the past few years the grim outlook from annual Emissions Gap reports barely changed, Olhoff said. This year’s emissions gap report is accurate yet not surprising and the projected temperature range fits with other groups’ calculations, said Climate Analytics scientist Bill Hare, who wasn’t part of the report. Guterres reiterated his call for countries to phase out the use of fossil fuels in time to keep the 1.5 degree limit alive, saying “otherwise we're simply inflating the lifeboats while breaking the oars.” “We know now that the impacts of climate change, of global warming of somewhere between 2.5 and 3 degrees Celsius are going to be massive,” Olhoff said in an interview. “It’s basically not a future I think anybody would want for their children and grandchildren and so forth.

Joseph Li, who was installed by China's state-controlled Catholic church as an archbishop, visited the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in the morning, public broadcaster RTHK said.  Li's five-day tour came after the city's newly installed Cardinal Stephen Chow invited him to visit Hong Kong during a landmark trip to Beijing in April - the first visit to the Chinese capital by the city's bishop in nearly three decades.

Joseph Li, who was installed by China's state-controlled Catholic church as an archbishop, visited the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in the morning, public broadcaster RTHK said.  Li's five-day tour came after the city's newly installed Cardinal Stephen Chow invited him to visit Hong Kong during a landmark trip to Beijing in April - the first visit to the Chinese capital by the city's bishop in nearly three decades. Experts said the invitation was a symbolic gesture that could strengthen the fragile relationship between China and the Vatican.

The Philippine Air Force said Wednesday its aircraft had taken part in joint patrols the day before in the vicinity of Batanes, the northernmost province of the Philippines, which is only about 200 kilometers (125 miles) fromTaiwan, a self-governed island that China claims as its own. The patrols run through Thursday and also include both the U.S. and Philippine navies. They come only days after Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. called the situation in the South China Sea increasingly “dire” as China seeks to assert its presence in an area where multiple nations have competing territorial claims. Asked about the patrols, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Beijing's position had been made clear to both the Philippines and the U.S. “The Philippines-U.S. joint patrol drill must not undermine China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests,” she said. The U.S. 7th Fleet said the patrols were part of routine American interaction with its allies and partners in “preserving a free and open Indo-Pacific region.” China claims virtually the entire South China Sea as its own waters, which has led to disputes not only with the Philippines but also with Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei. These claims have long been regarded as potential flashpoints in the region, and have fueled U.S.-China rivalry. Earlier this month a Chinese coast guard ship blasted a Philippine supply ship with a water cannon in disputed waters, and last month a Chinese coast guard ship and an accompanying vessel rammed a Philippine coast guard ship and a military-run supply boat near a contested shoal, according to Philippine officials. Speaking on Sunday in Honolulu, Marcos said China has been showing interest in atolls and shoals that are “closer and closer” to the coast of the Philippines, with the nearest atoll about 60 nautical miles (111 kilometers) away. “Unfortunately, I cannot report that the situation is improving,” Marcos said. “The situation has become more dire than it was before.” In announcing the start of the joint patrols, Marcos said on X, formerly known asTwitter, that they were “testament to our commitment to bolster the interoperability of our military forces.” “Through collaborative efforts, we aim to enhance regional security and foster a seamless partnership with the United States in safeguarding our shared interests,” he wrote. Under Marcos, who was elected last year, the Philippines has been deepening its relationship with the U.S. in a shift from his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who had been closer to China and Russia. In February, Marcos approved an expansion of the U.S. military presence in the Philippines to add four new bases from five existing sites under a 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement between the longtime treaty allies. The move, which Marcos said would boost the Philippines’ coastal defense, dovetails with the Biden administration’s efforts to strengthen an arc of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better counter China. Marcos has also been strengthening ties with others, including Tokyo, signing an agreement earlier in the year to allow Japanese troops to join training exercises.","BANGKOK --The United States and the Philippines are conducting joint air and maritime patrols in the SouthChinaSea, which come as the two countries step up cooperation in the face of growingly aggressive Chinese activity in the area.

Both Mr Blinken and UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said they were working with Israel, Egypt and ""other leading political voices in the region"" to re-open the crossing. The Israeli military ordered a blockade of Gaza and cut off the supply of water, food and fuel last week before launching a wave of air strikes in retaliation to Hamas' deadly attack on Israel during which militants raided communities, kidnapped civilians and soldiers and killed more than 1,400 people. On Monday morning, thousands of civilians rushed to the Rafah crossing following reports that it would be temporarily re-opened during a brief ceasefire on Monday. Both Israel and Hamas swiftly denied that any such agreement had been made.

Video analysed by BBC Verify appeared to show a strike on the crossing on Monday.  Israel has hit the area around the Rafah crossing point at least three times since it began its air campaign on Gaza.

Israel says the siege will not end until Hamas releases the hostages it seized from Israel on 7 October. The Israelis believe 199 people are being held in Gaza, up from an earlier estimate of 155. Around 2,750 people have died in Gaza since the Hamas assault and more than one million people have been displaced. ""There is an urgent need to alleviate the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza,"" Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said on Monday morning, adding that talks with Israel had been fruitless. Cairo has been focusing on getting humanitarian aid for civilians into Gaza. Mr Shoukry said Egypt could allow medical evacuations and let in some Gazans with permission to travel. A number of countries, including the US and the UK, have recommended that its citizens head towards the Rafah crossing, ready for its possible reopening. Although Egypt appears to be prepared to re-open the Rafah crossing to allow foreign passport holders out and humanitarian aid in, it fears a massive influx of Palestinian refugees fleeing the war.

For the first four weeks of Israeli assault on Gaza, Syed Hassan Nasrallah was conspicuously silent. When he finally spoke, a week ago, the world listened anxiously: Would the leader of the Lebanese Hezbollah, the strongest militia in the region,declare a full-scale war on Israel? It was much ado about nothing. In his well-known fiery style, Nasrallah reiterated Hezbollah’s views on regional issues andwarned Israel. There was no big announcement, and the speech was not followed by fighters storming into Israel or even a token salvo of missiles. The standoff continued as usual: tension, skirmishes, and occasional flare-ups, all measurable and containable. His second speech, delivered Saturday, was much of the same. At least two things indicated that Saturday’s speech would alsonot be a significant declaration of waron Israel. First, its timing was led not by current events but those of some 40 years ago: Saturday is Hezbollah Martyrs Day, commemorating one of the first and most venerated suicide bombers who blew himself up amid Israeli troops in southern Lebanon in 1982, killing at least 80. The second indicator was that Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi is attending the Arab-Islamic summit on Gaza in Riyadh on Saturday, his first trip to Saudi Arabia since the two countries resumed diplomatic relations in March. Now, Tehran has said on several occasions that it does not want direct war with Israel, aware that it would easily become a wider conflict and drag in the United States. For its part, Washington sent the same message. But between doing nothing and “direct engagement”, Iran had and still has a middle-of-the-road option: engaging by proxy, through Hezbollah and the Houthis who would gladly show Israel their teeth. If Arabs will not go to war, if Iran will not go alone, the question on many people’s minds was whether its proxies might go, saving everyone’s face. The answer was always: Yes and no. Or rather, no and yes. Hezbollah never wanted to mount a full-scale land attack — and the Houthis could not do it across 2,000 kilometres (about 1,250 miles), even if they wanted to. But the two groups remain tied to Tehran, which provided them with initial training, equipment, and the know-how for indigenous production of weapons much more sophisticated than the homemade rockets both started with. Hezbollah’s arsenal is an eclectic mix of old and new, Eastern, Western, Iranian and locally produced weaponry. Some of it was demonstrated in an “open day” the group staged on May 21 in southern Lebanon. We had seen many of these weapons already, but the mix was interesting. Electronic rifles, shoulder-fired missiles, and lightly armed quadbuggies can tell us a lot about how Hezbollah would fight. At least two types of electronic anti-drone guns were demonstrated — believed to be useful in blocking smaller tactical drones, causing them to drop dead. Anti-aircraft shoulder-fired missiles — like the Chinese SK-18, also known as QW-18 — are a potent deterrent against low-flying aeroplanes and helicopters, although drones are difficult for them to hit. Rather than cumbersome, well-armoured vehicles, Hezbollah showed a fleet of practical four-wheel all-terrain lightly armed quad buggies that are fast, mobile, and can deploy on any terrain in northern Israel. Some carry machine guns, others anti-tank missiles like the Kornet or its Iranian copy, Dehleviyeh. Those teams can set up ambushes unnoticed and escape quickly. Against naval targets, Hezbollah has the Noor, an Iranian version of a Chinese anti-ship cruise missile it used to hit and nearly sink an Israeli corvette in 2006. Reliable sources have said the militia now also has the Russian-made Yakhont, which is much more potent and has a longer range. Finally, a recent Houthi demonstration of firepower gives us a clue about Hezbollah’s. The Yemeni group shot down one of the biggest US armed reconnaissance drones, MQ-9 Reaper, allegedly using a local modification of the old Soviet AA-10 Alamo air-to-air missile. If they can convert the AA-10 to be fired from the ground and tracked to the target, Hezbollah must be able to. Hezbollah is certainly ready and capable of a careful dose of escalation with Israel to a point just short of a full war, at any time. How long and how much it will remain politically held back from such action may depend on Iran and Nasrallah, who does not need to go into the nitty-gritty of military action. He can content himself with words, warnings, and threats. The military wing of Hezbollah would do the rest. So far, most of the fighting has been by drones, missiles, and artillery, and limited small-unit incursions on the ground, penetrating a few kilometres into enemy ground and then retreating — typical reconnaissance in force. Casualties have been contained, if the loss of more than 60 militiamen can be called that. Using its Burkan short-range rockets – which carry up to 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of explosives — and Iranian suicide drones, Hezbollah damaged or destroyed Israeli observation towers built on high ground along the border to reconnoitre into Lebanon. To date, the first real escalation came from Israel, not Hezbollah: On Saturday, its combat drone hit a vehicle in Zahrani, 45km (28 miles) inside Lebanon, as well as other yet unidentified targets deep in the region of Tyre. Hezbollah is certain to retaliate, most probably by sending some of its formidable long-range rockets deep into Israel, targeting cities beyond the reach of Hamas rockets.

The Australian government said mobile phones, landlines and broadband internet had all been affected. Optus CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin ruled out a cyber-attack but in an interview on ABC Radio did not give a reason for the hours-long outage. “It is highly unlikely [that the problem started within software in Optus networks], our systems are actually very stable … This is a very, very rare occurrence,” she said. “We are working really hard to get it up and running as soon as we possibly can.” As a result of the outage, dozens of hospitals were unable to receive phone calls and it was not possible to make emergency calls from landlines on the Optus network. The poisons hotline in the state of New South Wales said it had also been affected. About six hours after the disruption began, Optus said some services had started to be restored but it would take some time before the network was fully up and running.

A former British intelligence officer was jailed for 13 years after attempting to kill a United States National Security Agency (NSA) employee in a “premeditated, targeted and vicious attack”. Joshua Bowles, 29, repeatedly stabbed the unnamed woman, who was working at British intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), in March near its base at Cheltenham, England. Bowles, who had previously worked at GCHQ, was no longer working there when he carried out the attack. Following his arrest, Bowles told the police, “The target was selected for employment at the NSA.” “Due to the size and resourcing, American intelligence represents the largest contributor within the intelligence community, so made sense as the symbolic target. I consider GCHQ just as guilty.” Judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said on Monday that Bowles had carried out a “politically motivated attack” that was driven by “anger and resentment” towards GCHQ and women. She recommended he serve at least 13 years in prison before being considered for release. In August, Bowles pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of the woman known only as 99230. He also pleaded guilty to assaulting a man who tried to stop the attack. The woman sustained cuts to her abdomen, chest and thigh. He had researched the attack online beforehand, including studying the American “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski, who mounted an anonymous bombing campaign from 1978 to 1995. Bowles also looked up attacks on women and white supremacy. In one of his police interviews, Bowles said: “The system is rigged. I believe the intelligence community helps ensure this rigging, this view has been reinforced by my time working at GCHQ.” Prosecutor Duncan Penny told London’s Old Bailey on Friday that Bowles launched the attack outside of a leisure centre in Cheltenham after researching two other US nationals who worked for the NSA at GCHQ. Penny said Bowles’s motivations “demonstrate that his use of serious violence against 99230 was designed to influence the UK government, by inference, not to work with or not to work as closely with the US National Security Agency and/or was designed to intimidate those working at GCHQ”. Penny also said Bowles described himself as a “terrorist” after the attack, saying to one witness: “I make a pretty s*** terrorist, don’t I?” Bowles’s lawyer, Tim Forte, argued that he attacked as a result of his social isolation and depression combined with his grievance against GCHQ.

The journal writings by Connor Sturgeon were contained in a 64-page report released Tuesday by Louisville police, where authorities say they have now closed the investigation into the actions of the 25-year-old who also died that day in an exchange of gunfire with authorities. Sturgeon wrote that it “was so easy” to purchase the assault rifle, a Radical Firearms RF-15, from a Louisville gun store, according to the police file. He bought the rifle, 120 rounds and four magazine cartridges for $700 six days before the shooting, and the process took about 45 minutes, he said. “Seriously, I knew it would be doable but this is ridiculous,” he wrote. He also acknowledged his struggles with mental illness and said he was dissatisfied with his job and the direction his life was taking. He wrote that he was “very sick” and suggested that he had lied about his health to avoid further treatment or institutionalization. The April 10 shootings began when Sturgeon opened fire in a conference room in the downtown high-rise bank building. One of the first officers to respond was struck in the head and critically wounded. Another officer shot and killed the gunman in the lobby. Sturgeon fired more than 40 rounds over the course of about eight minutes, according to the report. Investigators remarked that it appeared he “did not have a firm understanding” of how to operate the weapon. The report noted that investigators did not find “evidence of long-term planning,” though there were references in his journals to what he intended to do in the days beforehand. Nor did investigators find evidence he made extensive online searches related to gun violence. Sturgeon’s family has said they intend to sue the maker of the rifle used in the attack. His parents said his mental health struggle began a year earlier with panic attacks, anxiety and a suicide attempt, but he was seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication. His mother, Lisa Sturgeon, said his roommate called her the morning of the shooting to say Sturgeon told him by phone: “I’m going to go in and shoot up Old National.” She called 911, but her son was already at the bank. The five employees killed were Joshua Barrick, 40, a senior vice president; Deana Eckert, 57, an executive administrative officer; Tommy Elliott, 63, also a senior vice president; Juliana Farmer, 45, a loan analyst; and Jim Tutt Jr., 64, a commercial real estate market executive.

As China experiences its first winter without strict COVID-19 restrictions since the outbreak of the pandemic three years ago, a wave ofrespiratory illnessesis sweeping across the country. The unusual rise in cases has prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to prod China for additional information on the outbreak and seek enhanced response measures. Although the cause of this trend is unclear, some health experts are attributing it to a common and temporary aftereffect of lifting lockdown restrictions, even as unanswered questions around the infections and the country of their spread have led others to draw parallels with the early days of thepandemic. Here is what to know about the current situation with the outbreak and what to expect: Authorities from China’s National Health Commission attributed the rise in cases to the lifting of COVID-19restrictions. Health experts have also agreed that this could be the reason, similar to the “lockdown exit wave” that was witnessed in countries like the United Kingdom. China may be repaying an “immunity debt” after their lengthy lockdown, “which must have drastically reduced the circulation of respiratory bugs and hence decreased immunity to endemic bugs”, Francois Belloux, director of University College London’s Genetic Institute, said in a statement posted on X. He added that based on current information, “there is no reason to suspect the emergence of a novel pathogen” and that Mycoplasma pneumoniae, the probable source of most cases and a bacteria that typically affects younger children, is “generally fairly harmless”. Chinese authorities listed mycoplasma as one of the circulating pathogens along with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causesCOVID-19. The WHO has asked China for more information on the recent patterns of these microorganisms. While the presence of a novel pathogen is a possibility until more information is made available, the outbreak could also be due to “an existing but newly mutated pathogen with modified characteristics and severity”, said Laith Abu-Raddad, professor of healthcare policy and research at Weill Cornell Medicine in Qatar. “Both scenarios would be of global concern as pathogens will cross national borders sooner or later regardless of preventive measures,” he said. At their press conference, Chinese authorities said there is a need to step up disease surveillance and strengthen the capacity of health systems. The WHO and medical staff in China have also advised people in the country to reinforcepracticesfrom the COVID-19 pandemic era, such as rigorous handwashing, wearing masks and social distancing. In Liaoning Province, people have been queueing up at traditional Chinese medicine hospitals while patients at Dalian Children’s Hospital have had to wait in line for two hours, according to the ProMED report. Although medical staff are concerned about the spike in infections in people under 18, they are also worried about vulnerable populations such as the elderly and pregnant women, Yu reported outside Beijing Children’s Hospital as a steady stream of parents walked hand-in-hand with their children behind her. Abu Raddad noted that the incidence in children could suggest that older individuals have some immunity to the pathogen that is rampant, possibly RSV, and so a cause for less concern since a new vaccine is available for the virus. Experts have agreed that moredefinitive informationis needed on the illnesses.

Police had turned up at St Andrew's Cathedral School just before midnight, after a chilling triple-zero emergency call. There they encountered a ""confronting scene"" - 21-year-old water polo coach Lilie James, dead, with extensive head injuries.  Detectives believe she was murdered - allegedly with a hammer - hours earlier, according to local media who have cited anonymous sources. CCTV had reportedly captured her colleague, 24-year-old hockey coach Paul Thijssen, entering the bathroom after her. Thijssen, who also made the call to authorities, later emerged alone. Though police have made no public comments about a potential motive, local media have reported Ms James had recently ended a relationship with Thijssen. They had been seeing each other for only five weeks.  Thijssen had vanished after calling in the tip-off from Vaucluse, and police launched a major manhunt focused on the cliffside suburb. There they found items ""associated with the homicide"" - allegedly the murder weapon - in a bin, and on Friday morning, a body which was later confirmed to be Thijssen. As friends and family reckoned with the death of Ms James, they remembered her as kind friend and an avid sportswoman. Along with water polo, she loved dancing and swimming, doing both competitively as a teenager. And she had been studying a sports business degree at university, working at the school on the side. ""She was vibrant, outgoing, and very much loved by her family and friends,"" Ms James's family said in a statement. ""We are devastated and heartbroken."" Ms James was ""stolen from us"", family friend Daniel Makovec wrote in a fundraising appeal for the family. ""We will be grieving this loss forever,"" he said. In a note to parents, the head of St Andrew's Cathedral School said she was deeply concerned for all involved. ""The horrors of evil do not, and will not, define our community, that is my oath,"" Julie McGonigle said. Mr Thijssen, a Dutch national, was a former sports captain at the school before he became a staff member. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns too sent his condolences to Ms James's family, describing her death as a ""horrible, horrible crime"". ""[It is] one of the worst that I've seen in my public life, and I can only imagine what [the] family is going through right now,"" he said. The case has reignited conversation about how Australia has long struggled to move the needle on what is often called an ""epidemic"" of domestic violence in the country. Ms James is the 41st Australian woman this year to die allegedly as a result of gendered violence, according to the Counting Dead Women project. In the past 10 days alone, three women - South Australian Krystal Marshall, an unnamed Canberra woman and Ms James - have all allegedly been killed by men they knew. All were inside their own homes or workplace. Gendered violence reform campaigner Tarang Chawla - whose sister was murdered by her partner in 2015 - said Ms James's death is a ""tragic reminder of the dark, insidious reality of men's violence against women"". ""I look at the photos of Lilie and I remember my own 23-year-old sister Niki and how I felt after she was murdered,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""Lilie, I'm sorry we failed you."" And while the nation grieves, urgent questions are again being asked about how to keep women safe.  Australia has had a National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children since 2010, but the statistics show the rates of violence remain stubbornly high. A new 10-year plan was introduced last year - this time with actionable targets. It places emphasis on early intervention, improving police and justice responses, creating more emergency housing and increasing the trauma support available to victim survivors. But CEO of Full Stop Australia, Karen Bevan, says it is concerning ""cultural attitudes towards gender equality and violence against women"" that underpin Australia's domestic violence scourge. According to a recent survey, while more than 90% of Australians recognise violence against women is a problem in the country, just under half say it is a problem in their own suburb or town. The same study also found around four in 10 Australians wrongly believe men and women are equally likely to commit domestic violence. Ms Bevan says that addressing ""myths and misconceptions"" of how and why violence against women occurs and greater ""community understanding"" is key.  NSW Minister for Domestic Violence Prevention, Jodie Harrison, has also appealed for the community to better call out ""inappropriate behaviour"" in the wake of Ms James's death. ""That's really the start of a lack of safety for women and children,"" she told Guardian Australia. ""It's up to every single one of us. Government can fund programs but unless individuals take responsibility for themselves, that government funding will be wasted."" But advocates say more funding and measures to track progress are also needed.  ""For all the violence elsewhere that we condemn, Australia has a problem that we urgently need to fix,"" Mr Chawla said.","On Thursday, as Australia woke to the news a body had been found inside the bathroom of an elite Sydney private school, horror rippled around the country.

There they encountered a ""confronting scene"" - 21-year-old water polo coach Lilie James, dead, with extensive head injuries.  Detectives believe she was murdered - allegedly with a hammer - hours earlier, according to local media who have cited anonymous sources. CCTV had reportedly captured her colleague, 24-year-old hockey coach Paul Thijssen, entering the bathroom after her. Thijssen, who also made the call to authorities, later emerged alone. Though police have made no public comments about a potential motive, local media have reported Ms James had recently ended a relationship with Thijssen. They had been seeing each other for only five weeks.  Thijssen had vanished after calling in the tip-off from Vaucluse, and police launched a major manhunt focused on the cliffside suburb. There they found items ""associated with the homicide"" - allegedly the murder weapon - in a bin, and on Friday morning, a body which was later confirmed to be Thijssen. As friends and family reckoned with the death of Ms James, they remembered her as kind friend and an avid sportswoman. Along with water polo, she loved dancing and swimming, doing both competitively as a teenager. And she had been studying a sports business degree at university, working at the school on the side. ""She was vibrant, outgoing, and very much loved by her family and friends,"" Ms James's family said in a statement. ""We are devastated and heartbroken."" Ms James was ""stolen from us"", family friend Daniel Makovec wrote in a fundraising appeal for the family. ""We will be grieving this loss forever,"" he said. In a note to parents, the head of St Andrew's Cathedral School said she was deeply concerned for all involved. ""The horrors of evil do not, and will not, define our community, that is my oath,"" Julie McGonigle said. Mr Thijssen, a Dutch national, was a former sports captain at the school before he became a staff member. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns too sent his condolences to Ms James's family, describing her death as a ""horrible, horrible crime"". ""[It is] one of the worst that I've seen in my public life, and I can only imagine what [the] family is going through right now,"" he said. The case has reignited conversation about how Australia has long struggled to move the needle on what is often called an ""epidemic"" of domestic violence in the country. Ms James is the 41st Australian woman this year to die allegedly as a result of gendered violence, according to the Counting Dead Women project. In the past 10 days alone, three women - South Australian Krystal Marshall, an unnamed Canberra woman and Ms James - have all allegedly been killed by men they knew. All were inside their own homes or workplace. Gendered violence reform campaigner Tarang Chawla - whose sister was murdered by her partner in 2015 - said Ms James's death is a ""tragic reminder of the dark, insidious reality of men's violence against women"". ""I look at the photos of Lilie and I remember my own 23-year-old sister Niki and how I felt after she was murdered,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""Lilie, I'm sorry we failed you."" And while the nation grieves, urgent questions are again being asked about how to keep women safe.  Australia has had a National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children since 2010, but the statistics show the rates of violence remain stubbornly high. A new 10-year plan was introduced last year - this time with actionable targets. It places emphasis on early intervention, improving police and justice responses, creating more emergency housing and increasing the trauma support available to victim survivors. But CEO of Full Stop Australia, Karen Bevan, says it is concerning ""cultural attitudes towards gender equality and violence against women"" that underpin Australia's domestic violence scourge. According to a recent survey, while more than 90% of Australians recognise violence against women is a problem in the country, just under half say it is a problem in their own suburb or town. The same study also found around four in 10 Australians wrongly believe men and women are equally likely to commit domestic violence. Ms Bevan says that addressing ""myths and misconceptions"" of how and why violence against women occurs and greater ""community understanding"" is key.  NSW Minister for Domestic Violence Prevention, Jodie Harrison, has also appealed for the community to better call out ""inappropriate behaviour"" in the wake of Ms James's death. ""That's really the start of a lack of safety for women and children,"" she told Guardian Australia. ""It's up to every single one of us. Government can fund programs but unless individuals take responsibility for themselves, that government funding will be wasted."" But advocates say more funding and measures to track progress are also needed.

Authorities in the United States have thwarted a plot to kill a Sikh separatist in the country and issued a warning to India over concerns the government in New Delhi was involved, the Financial Times has reported. Citing unnamed sources, the FT on Wednesday identified Gurpatwant Singh Pannun as the target of the allegedly foiled plot. The report said Pannun had declined to say whether US authorities had warned him about the plot, but quoted him as saying he would “let the US government respond to the issue of threats to my life on American soil from the Indian operatives”. There was no immediate response from India’s Ministry of External Affairs or the US embassy in New Delhi to requests for comment on the report, the Reuters news agency said. The FT report said the sources did not say if the protest to India resulted in the plot being abandoned by the plotters, or if it was foiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The protest to New Delhi was registered after Prime Minister Narendra Modi was welcomed on a state visit by President Joe Biden in June, said the report, which came two months after Canada said there were “credible” allegations linking Indian agents to the June murder of a Sikh separatist leader,Hardeep Singh Nijjar, in a Vancouver suburb.      India has rejected Canada’s accusations. Apart from the diplomatic warning to India, US federal prosecutors have also filed a sealed indictment against at least one suspect in a New York district court, the FT report said.

Apple did not reply to requests for comment. The iPhone, in contrast, is set to end the year with a 50% increase in shipments, at a time when the overall smartphone industry could decline 2%. Taking the 152 million total smartphone shipments in CY22 as the base, this means total shipments will settle near 149 million. Of this, 6% will be iPhones at about 8.9 million units.

In FY23,  Apple India’s revenue surged 48%  to Rs 49,321 crore, while net profit shot up 76% to Rs 2,229 crore. Despite having just about 5% market share in terms of units, the company had the second largest share in terms of revenue in 2022 at 18%, just behind South Korea’s Samsung.   ETtech Premium placement bites The biggest hindrance to growth in the sale of non-iPhone devices is their prices, said analysts and retailers. iPads retail between Rs 32,900 and Rs 81,900, while the Mac retails at Rs 99,900 to over Rs 1,70,000. The “sweet spot” where most tablet sales happen is closer to the Rs 20,000 mark, while for laptops, it is between Rs 30,000 and Rs 40,000, said Akshara Bassi, senior research analyst at Counterpoint. Moreover, 30% to 35% of the overall laptop market is bulk enterprise sales for office work, where the comparatively cheaper  Lenovo  and Dell brands are preferred. Pricing disparity with competing products, inflationary pressures, and a reluctance to move away from the popular Windows operating system are hurting sales, Bassi said. Over that, the overall tab market will also likely decline between 10% to 15% in 2023, while laptop and PC shipments will likely remain flat. Two categories will be insulated from this subdued market. While the True Wireless Stereo ( TWS ) category is poised to grow between 45% to 50%, smartwatch sales will likely grow between 65% and 70% this year, said Anshika Jain, senior research analyst at Counterpoint.  Once again, pricing plagues demand for Apple products in these two growing categories. Airpods cost between Rs 12,900 and Rs 24,900, while the Apple Watch retails between Rs 29,900 and Rs 89,900. Both are very distant from the so-called sweet spots with most TWS sales happening under Rs 3,000, while the majority of the smartwatches bought cost less than Rs 5,000, Jain said. In both the TWS and wearable segments, brands such as Boat and Boult are constantly launching a plethora of cheaper options to entice customers, said Manish Girias, who runs the Girias chain of electronic stores. “The cheaper brands are also getting better at making products that look as good as the Airpods, so customers, who are mostly young, are happy,” he added. Rajkumar Pai, founder of electronics retailer  Pai Electronics , said his chain sells 100 to 150 units each of the four Apple ecosystem devices per month, against 3,000 to 4,000 iPhones.  More than just a phone The iPhone is also an expensive product, retailing from Rs 49,900 to upwards of Rs 134,900. But various factors, from increased discounting and improving supplies to aggressive marketing and robust financing schemes, have fuelled a surge in iPhone sales over the past few years. iPhone shipments nearly doubled in 2021, and grew 16% in 2022, according to Counterpoint data. “Apple has now expanded 24/0 financing (24 instalments, 0% interest rate) to all our sale counters, and amped up the supply…They also nailed the festive season sale really well this time,” said Amit Mulchandani, executive director at Mumbai-based retailer Digi1 Electronics. The US tech giant seems to be happy letting the iPhone drive the sales surge, multiple sellers opined. “In emerging markets like India, it is important to reach a certain critical mass before Apple can leverage that to sell ecosystem devices. The iPhone is often the most important driver of this,” said Pathak.  The presence of a robust refurbished market for older iPhones also helps, as does the aspirational value, analysts and sellers say. But as the installed base grows from about 20-25 million currently, other ecosystem devices and services such as Apple Music—a small fraction of total India revenues currently—will become crucial. “We expect the next focus to be the Mac and the iPad, because a user has truly logged in to the ecosystem when they have an iPhone and a Mac, as opposed to, say, an iPhone and Airpods…The in-house M series of chips could become an important upgrade opportunity in this regard,” Pathak said.

Bangladesh’s prime minister has offered a stern response to striking garment workers amid deadly clashes over pay. After unions rejected a government offer, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Friday rejected the demands of the protesting workers for a higher pay rise. The premier insisted that they accept the offer on the table or “go back to their village”. Union leaders expressed concern that her words could provoke more violence from police and security forces. Large protests have resulted in at least three deaths over the past two weeks. In response, a government-appointed panel agreed on Tuesday to raise the minimum wage by 56.25 percent to 12,500 taka ($113). However, unions swiftly rejected the offer, demanding instead 23,000 taka ($208), and the unrest has continued. Bangladesh’s 3,500 garment factories account for about 85 percent of the country’s $55bn in annual exports, supplying many of the world’s top brands including Levi’s, Zara and H&M. But conditions are dire for many of the sector’s four million workers, the vast majority of whom are women whose monthly pay starts at 8,300 taka ($75). “I would say to the garment workers: they have to work with whatever [level to which] their salary is increased, they should continue their work,” Hasina told a meeting of her ruling Awami League party on Thursday evening. The protests have left at least three workers dead and more than 70 factories ransacked since last week, according to police. “If they take to the streets to protest at someone’s instigation, they will lose their job, lose their work and will have to return to their village,” Hasina added. “If these factories are closed, if production is disrupted, exports are disrupted, where will their jobs be? They have to understand that.” Hasina said 19 factories were “attacked and destroyed”, businesses that “give them bread and butter and food and employment”. A union leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Hasina’s speech had created a “climate of fear” in the industry, warning it had given security forces permission to crack down further on protests. Police have arrested more than 100 protesters, including several union leaders, over charges of violence and vandalising factories, two police officers told the AFP news agency. On Thursday, police reported violence in the key industrial towns of Gazipur and Ashulia, outside the capital, Dhaka, after more than 25,000 workers staged protests in factories and along highways to reject the wage panel’s offer. Rashedul Alam Raju, a garment union leader, urged Hasina to listen to workers’ demands. “The prime minister can raise the wages after reconsidering the situation,” Raju said. However, Hasina said that garment workers have been offered a bigger raise than civil servants. “Government officers have got a five percent hike, since there is inflation all over the world – and they [garment workers] will get 56 percent raise,” she said. But union leaders retorted that the level of the respective wages is incomparable. Unions said they dismissed the government’s offer because the pay increase does not match the soaring cost of food, rent, healthcare and school fees for their children.      The Netherlands-based Clean Clothes Campaign, a textile workers’ rights group, dismissed the new pay level as a “poverty wage”. “If brands backed the 23,000 taka [$207] amount demanded by trade unions, and committed to absorbing the cost of the wage increase, workers would not have to go out on the streets and protest,” group spokesman Bogu Gojdz told AFP. “We see living wage-committed brands – such as ASOS, Uniqlo, H&M, C&A, M&S, Aldi and Next – as particularly responsible in this situation,” Gojdz added. “While they claim to be committed to paying their workers fair wages, they refuse to support the bare minimum wage workers need to survive.” Washington has condemned violence against protesting workers. The United States, which is one of the largest buyers of Bangladesh-made garments, has called for a wage that “addresses the growing economic pressures faced by workers and their families”.

The premier insisted that they accept the offer on the table or “go back to their village”. Union leaders expressed concern that her words could provoke more violence from police and security forces. Large protests have resulted in at least three deaths over the past two weeks. In response, a government-appointed panel agreed on Tuesday to raise the minimum wage by 56.25 percent to 12,500 taka ($113). However, unions swiftly rejected the offer, demanding instead 23,000 taka ($208), and the unrest has continued. Bangladesh’s 3,500 garment factories account for about 85 percent of the country’s $55bn in annual exports, supplying many of the world’s top brands including Levi’s, Zara and H&M. But conditions are dire for many of the sector’s four million workers, the vast majority of whom are women whose monthly pay starts at 8,300 taka ($75). “I would say to the garment workers: they have to work with whatever [level to which] their salary is increased, they should continue their work,” Hasina told a meeting of her ruling Awami League party on Thursday evening. The protests have left at least three workers dead and more than 70 factories ransacked since last week, according to police. “If they take to the streets to protest at someone’s instigation, they will lose their job, lose their work and will have to return to their village,” Hasina added. “If these factories are closed, if production is disrupted, exports are disrupted, where will their jobs be? They have to understand that.” Hasina said 19 factories were “attacked and destroyed”, businesses that “give them bread and butter and food and employment”. A union leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Hasina’s speech had created a “climate of fear” in the industry, warning it had given security forces permission to crack down further on protests. Police have arrested more than 100 protesters, including several union leaders, over charges of violence and vandalising factories, two police officers told the AFP news agency. On Thursday, police reported violence in the key industrial towns of Gazipur and Ashulia, outside the capital, Dhaka, after more than 25,000 workers staged protests in factories and along highways to reject the wage panel’s offer. Rashedul Alam Raju, a garment union leader, urged Hasina to listen to workers’ demands. “The prime minister can raise the wages after reconsidering the situation,” Raju said. However, Hasina said that garment workers have been offered a bigger raise than civil servants. “Government officers have got a five percent hike, since there is inflation all over the world – and they [garment workers] will get 56 percent raise,” she said. But union leaders retorted that the level of the respective wages is incomparable. Unions said they dismissed the government’s offer because the pay increase does not match the soaring cost of food, rent, healthcare and school fees for their children.      The Netherlands-based Clean Clothes Campaign, a textile workers’ rights group, dismissed the new pay level as a “poverty wage”. “If brands backed the 23,000 taka [$207] amount demanded by trade unions, and committed to absorbing the cost of the wage increase, workers would not have to go out on the streets and protest,” group spokesman Bogu Gojdz told AFP. “We see living wage-committed brands – such as ASOS, Uniqlo, H&M, C&A, M&S, Aldi and Next – as particularly responsible in this situation,” Gojdz added. “While they claim to be committed to paying their workers fair wages, they refuse to support the bare minimum wage workers need to survive.” Washington has condemned violence against protesting workers. The United States, which is one of the largest buyers of Bangladesh-made garments, has called for a wage that “addresses the growing economic pressures faced by workers and their families”.

Lord Cameron reiterated the UK's support for Ukraine, promising moral, diplomatic and ""above all military support for... however long it takes"". Mr Zelensky congratulated Mr Cameron on his new post and thanked him for the UK's continued backing. Lord Cameron became foreign secretary in a cabinet shuffle on Monday. ""This is very important, especially now, when the world is paying attention not only to the situation on the battlefield in Ukraine, and dividing the focus really does not help,"" the Ukrainian president said, alluding to the Middle East. ""We are grateful for the unwavering support of Ukraine from the United Kingdom. We are grateful for the warm welcome of Ukrainian citizens in the UK. And we are glad that you came to Ukraine,"" he said. Mr Zelensky posted a short clip of the meeting to social media, during which Lord Cameron can be heard saying ""I wanted this to be my first visit."" ""What I want to say by being here is that we will continue to give you the moral support, the diplomatic support and the economic support and above all the military support that you need not just this year and next year but however long as it takes,"" Lord Cameron said. The former UK prime minister added: ""I've had some disagreements with Boris Johnson, we've known each other for 40 years, but his support for you was the finest thing he and his government did."" Ukraine's foreign ministry said the pair discussed weapons, arms production, and security in the Black Sea. In a statement following the meeting, Lord Cameron said: ""As winter approaches, we continue to stand with the Ukrainian people as they resist Putin's illegal invasion. In the last three months, they have pushed Russia back in the Black Sea and are opening vital sea trade routes for the Ukrainian economy and global food supplies.""  Lord Cameron left Ukraine on Thursday afternoon. The UK has provided Ukraine with billions of pounds in military aid since Russia launched its invasion in February 2022. Military hardware donations have included a number of Challenger 2 tanks and long-range missiles, and tens of thousands of Ukrainian recruits have been trained by the British military on UK soil. Lord Cameron's visit comes after Ukrainian forces succeeded in establishing positions across the Dnipro river in southern Ukraine, a potentially significant advance. Local Russian-installed officials acknowledged on Wednesday that Ukrainian forces were present in the village of Krynky, on the Russian-occupied left (east) bank. The river has separated Ukrainian and Russian forces since Moscow's troops withdrew from Kherson a year ago.  The news has heartened Ukrainians, whose four-month-old counter-offensive has failed to regain significant occupied territory from Russia. Lord Cameron's new post marks his return to the cabinet table for the first time in more than seven years. He has replaced James Cleverly, who was moved to be home secretary to take over from Suella Braverman in a dramatical overhaul of Rishi Sunak's cabinet on Monday. Lord Cameron was prime minister from 2010 to 2016, resigning after the UK voted to leave the EU as he had backed the Remain campaign. In the time since, Lord Cameron has occupied himself with various business endeavours, charity work, teaching and speaking engagements. There has been some controversy about Lord Cameron's return to the cabinet, since he is no longer an elected MP and will sit as a peer rather than in the Commons. Opposition parties and Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle have raised concerns about how MPs will be able to hold Lord Cameron to account, given he will not be in the Commons chamber to take questions during the regular departmental scrutiny sessions. Instead, those questions will be fielded by the ministers below him at the Foreign Office, including Andrew Mitchell and Anne-Marie Trevelyan. It is not uncommon for deputies to answer for the department, although this normally occurs if the foreign secretary is on diplomatic visits around the world.","New Foreign Secretary David Cameron has made his first working visit to Ukraine, meeting President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv.

Israel seeks to end the Palestinian people’s presence on their “historical land,” Palestine’s foreign minister has said. Riyad al-Maliki’s comments came as diplomats from Arab and Muslim-majority nations met their Chinese counterparts in Beijing on Monday. Beijing is hosting a delegation of foreign ministers from the Palestinian Authority, Indonesia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan for talks aimed at finding a solution to end the war in the Gaza Strip. The summit, during which China pledged to work to “restore peace in the Middle East,” is seen as part of a push by Beijing to step up its international role. The Palestinian Authority’s al-Maliki accused Israel of seeking to “bring to an end the Palestinian people’s presence on what remains of its historical land,” AFP reports. A spokesperson for Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip will threaten peace, security and stability in the region and the world. “Egypt is making every effort to bring aid into the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing, but Israel’s policy of obstructing the entry of aid is a systematic policy aimed at pushing the Palestinians to leave the strip under the weight of bombing and siege,” the spokesperson said. China, the host of the summit, has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinians. Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the visiting diplomats that his country could see that “a humanitarian disaster is unfolding in Gaza” and that it must be stopped. “The situation in Gaza affects all countries around the world, questioning the human sense of right and wrong and humanity’s bottom line,” he said, before urging the international community to “act urgently” to prevent the war from spreading. Following the outbreak of the war last month, Wang reportedly told his Saudi counterpart Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud in a phone call that “Israel’s actions have gone beyond self-defence”. Wang and other Chinese officials called for an immediate ceasefire and a “cooling down” of the situation. Beijing has repeatedly called for a two-state solution to end the war, which has now killed more than 13,000 Palestinian people in Gaza and some 1,200 in Israel. Beijing’s Middle East envoy Zhai Jun visited the region last month seeking a solution to end the war and has been in talks with Russia to work together to help Israel and Palestine reach a two-state solution. At the summit, Wang highlighted again that Beijing is “a good friend and brother of Arab and Muslim countries”.

The meetings are a sign that China is stepping up its international role by filling a power vacuum left by the US, according to political analyst Ibrahim Fraihat. “The US has shot itself in the foot by throwing all of its weight behind Israel’s side and by doing so, it has diminished its role as a credible third party intervener,” Fraihat, of the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera. “They [Chinese authorities] are very interested in this role – they have strong ties with Israel, they have the trust of the Palestinians and weight in the international system,” he added, referring to China’s veto power at the UN Security Council.

CEO Bob Iger has said Disney wants to keep ESPN and will try to create a streaming app for it by either forming a joint venture or finding a buyer for a minority stake in the network.  That means a 36% interest in ESPN would be up for sale, assuming Disney intends to retain a 51% majority interest and accounting for media company Hearst's 20% stake,  BofA  analysts led by Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote in a note published Wednesday.  Interested parties could include leagues like the  National Football League  and the  National Basketball Association , newcomers like Apple and Amazon.com, which are jostling to get into live sports, and distributors like Verizon and  Comcast , the note said.  Disney would gain a lot from the deal as more capital would mean ESPN would be able to strengthen its offerings, keep the option of a spin-off open and help the network focus on high-growth streaming, the brokerage said.  Rising cord-cutting has hit the linear television business, and acquiring sports rights has become an increasingly expensive affair, with future sports rights expected to be north of $69 billion.  Benefits to prospective buyers, however, appear ""nebulous"", BofA said.  ""ESPN is still a strong business and a  premier  brand, but it sits at the nexus of possible major business transformation.

That means a 36% interest in ESPN would be up for sale, assuming Disney intends to retain a 51% majority interest and accounting for media company Hearst's 20% stake,  BofA  analysts led by Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote in a note published Wednesday.  Interested parties could include leagues like the  National Football League  and the  National Basketball Association , newcomers like Apple and Amazon.com, which are jostling to get into live sports, and distributors like Verizon and  Comcast , the note said.  Disney would gain a lot from the deal as more capital would mean ESPN would be able to strengthen its offerings, keep the option of a spin-off open and help the network focus on high-growth streaming, the brokerage said.  Rising cord-cutting has hit the linear television business, and acquiring sports rights has become an increasingly expensive affair, with future sports rights expected to be north of $69 billion.  Benefits to prospective buyers, however, appear ""nebulous"", BofA said.  ""ESPN is still a strong business and a  premier  brand, but it sits at the nexus of possible major business transformation. Transitions have historically proven difficult and typically not conducive to significant growth,"" it added.  Experience Your Economic Times Newspaper, The Digital Way!

However, whether current Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards will call a special session to redraw the political boundaries and if Republican Gov.-elect Jeff Landry, who will be inaugurated Jan. 8, will have enough time to call a special redistricting session and meet the court’s deadline has yet to be determined. If the Legislature does not pass a new map by mid-January, then the lower district court should conduct a trial and “decide on a plan for the 2024elections,” according to the order by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth District. The political tug-of-war and legal battle over Louisiana’s GOP-drawn congressional map has been going on for more than a year and a half — which has included Edwards vetoing the political boundaries and the Legislature overriding his veto, the first time in nearly three decades that lawmakers refused to accept a governor’s refusal of a bill they had passed. Louisiana is among states still wrangling over congressional districts after the U.S. Supreme Court in June ruled that Alabama had violated the Voting Rights Act. Louisiana’s current map, which was used in the November congressional election, has white majorities in five of six districts — despite Black people accounting for one-third of the state’s population. Republicans, who dominate Louisiana’s Legislature, say that the map is fair. They argue that Black populations in the state are too dispersed to be united into a second majority Black district. Democrats argue that the map discriminates against Black voters and that there should be two majority-minority districts. Currently, five of the six districts are held by Republicans. Another mostly Black district could deliver a second congressional seat to Democrats. In June 2022, a lower court struck down Louisiana’s map for violating the Voting Rights Act. U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick said in her ruling that “evidence of Louisiana’s long and ongoing history of voting-related discrimination weighs heavily in favor of Plaintiffs.” Dick ordered that the map be redrawn to include a second majority-Black district, before it was appealed to the 5th Circuit. In October, the Supreme Court rejected an emergency appeal from Black voters in Louisiana to speed the process of drawing new congressional districts in the state. Lawmakers now have until mid-January to draw and pass a new map, which would have to be done through a special session. A special session may be called by the governor or convened by the presiding officers of both chambers, upon a written petition of most elected members of the House and Senate. While Edwards has not said whether he will call a special session, he remains adamant that a second majority-Black district is necessary to accurately represent the state. “This is about simple math, basic fairness, and the rule of law,” Edwards said in a written statement. U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, the state’s sole Black and Democratic member of Congress, said he “sincerely” hopes the Legislature will draw a new map with a second majority-Black district. Carter posted on X, formerly known asTwitter, to urge lawmakers to “do the right thing” and that “there is no need to wait for a court to force compliance with clear law.” If Gov.-elect Landry calls a special session, the timing will be tricky — as Landry won’t be inaugurated until Jan. 8 and the session couldn’t start until seven days after the proclamation is issued, meaning the earliest lawmakers could return to the Capitol is the Jan. 15 deadline. Landry could not be reached for comment. However, in the appeals court’s order it does say that the district court will have discretion to grant “limited additional time” if requested.","BATON ROUGE, La. --TheLouisianaLegislature has until Jan. 15 to enact a new congressional map after a lower court last year ruled that the current political boundaries dilute the power of the state’s Black voters, a federal New Orleans appeals court said Friday.

His mother, Tetiana Yarema, has been preparing for months as she remembers last winter’s Russian strikes on the energy infrastructure that plungedUkraineinto darkness. “Those were dark days. I didn’t want anything. I just wanted to pack my things and go abroad,” said Yarema, 48, who says she ended up staying because of her son’s insistence. For the Yarema family, like millions of other Ukrainians touched by Russia’s war on Ukraine, winter is an especially challenging time. The mother and son live in trailers that were set up in their backyard after fighting in the early days of the war destroyed their house in Moshchun, a village about 25 kilometers (15 miles) northwest of Kyiv. “I have a feeling that when the cold sets in, they’ll start bombing again,” the woman said, echoing the sentiments of many Ukrainians. This time, however, they say they are better prepared. Sales of generators exploded toward the end of summer. Some, who can afford it, have invested in solar panels. Others, like Yarema, have been purchasing candles, batteries, flashlights, and portable lanterns and stocking up on compact gas canisters, making the most of discounted prices. “It’s a bit challenging … but I already know what to do,” she said. Last winter was declared the most challenging in the history of Ukraine’s energy system, with over 1,200 missiles and drones fired by Russians at power plants, according to Ukrainian state-owned grid operator, Ukrenergo. The strikes impacted almost a half of Ukraine’s energy capacity. People were forced to endure hours without electricity and water during the coldest months in what Ukrainian officials described as “energy terror."" Millions of people across Ukraine had to learn to work, live, and cover their basic needs without relying on electricity. After a lull of six months, Ukraine's energy system sustained its first attack of the season on Sept. 21, resulting in damage to facilities in the central and western regions, Ukrenergo said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has committed to substantially enhancing air defense systems, which already have demonstrated greater effectiveness than the previous year. “Everyone must play their part in defensive efforts to ensure that Russian aggression does not halt Ukraine this winter. Just as on the battlefield, in all areas, we must be resilient and strong,” Zelenskyy said in a recent address to the nation. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal recently announced that the United States has allocated $522 million for energy equipment and the protection of Ukraine's infrastructure. “We stand on the threshold of a difficult winter. Thanks to the assistance of our allies, we successfully weathered the last, which was the most challenging winter season in our history,” Shmyhal said. Major retailer Epicenter said sales of generators increased 80% in August compared to the same time last year, and sales of portable charging stations increased by 25 times. Yurii Musienko, 45, another resident of Moshchun, also plans to rely heavily on firewood, and has a wood-burning stove in his compact wooden trailer that has been provided to him for two years, and which sits next to his ruined home. “I’ve already adapted,” he said with a smile. The gates of his home still bear the holes from exploded ammunition that serve as a reminder of when Russian forces tried to seize the Ukrainian capital. “May no one ever have to endure such conditions,"" said his mother, Valentyna Kiriian, who lives in a separate plastic trailer installed in the same courtyard. She’s dressed in a hat and a coat, with multiple layers of clothing to stay warm. She notes that the cold has already set in, forcing her to sleep fully clothed, much like the previous winter. During the power outages last winter, the mother and son relied on cannedfood. Occasionally, Valentyna would visit her neighbor, whose house remained intact and had a gas stove for boiling water. “It’s difficult for me to talk about. It pains my soul, and my heart weeps,” she said. Private Ukrainian energy producer DTEK has spent the last seven months restoring its damaged infrastructure and fortifying the protection of its equipment for the approaching winter. The company invested about 20 billion Ukrainian hryvnias ($550 million) to prepare for the upcoming season, and it lost billions of hryvnias because of last year’s disruptions caused by Russian attacks, according to CEO Maxim Timchenko. “We learned our lessons,” Timchenko said. Andrii Horchynskyi, 49. who lives in the village of Maliutianka about 25 kilometers (15 miles) southwest of Kyiv, has invested over $30,000 in recent years to ensure his house is self-sufficient, and ramped up those efforts since Russia's invasion. Last year, he spent $12,000 to install solar panels to help power his spacious house, where other members of his extended family came to stay for the winter — eight of them surviving comfortably. “We had a whole ant heap here,” Horchynskyi recalled. He is convinced the Russians will try to damage Ukraine’s infrastructure for gas, which he thinks will become expensive or even unavailable. So, he has installed a boiler that burns pine pellets. He also stores one and half cubic meters of water in his backyard. “They will bombard even more this winter than the last,” Horchynskyi said. ___ Dmytro Zhyhinas contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine","MOSHCHUN, Ukraine --In the humble backyard of a destroyed house, a 13-year-old chops firewood to get ready for winter.

Last month also had the warmest October day for 97 years. Armagh Observatory, one of dozens of weather stations around Northern Ireland has recorded daily rainfall at its meteorological station since 1838. It recorded a total of 195.4mm rainfall in October, exceeding the 193.8mm observed 153 years ago. County Armagh was affected by severe flooding in some areas at the end of October and start of November. The Met Office has also said county Down had its wettest October ever. As well as being the warmest October day for almost a century, the temperature of 21.7C is the third highest October temperature ever recorded at the observatory. Its director Prof Michael Burton said the data sent a clear signal. ""There's no doubt in the pattern we're all seeing - these are all evidence of the world's changing climate,"" he said. ""Essentially the extreme will become more often and so you get more hot days, more wet days, you even get cold days as well. ""But it's the extreme - it's no longer an oddity, it's a regular event that these things are happening and they're happening everywhere."" It comes as communities in counties Down, Armagh and Antrim start to assess the damage after flooding this week. While Professor Burton said no single measurement should have too much read into it, he explained that a warmer atmosphere does hold more water and that means we are likely to experience more warmer, wetter winters. ""That's physics,"" he added. When it comes to discerning climate change in action, the more evidence you can gather, the better. And more than 200 years' worth of consistent records make for a lot of evidence. It allows patterns and changes to be clearly detected. The records at Armagh Observatory show definitively that climate change is affecting our lives here and now. As well as more rainfall as the result of a warming atmosphere, the increasing temperature can also be seen in the data and these all present challenges for us to adapt to. But they are also a signal that time to mitigate the impact of climate change is running out.","October 2023 was the wettest month on record in County Armagh, breaking the previous record set in 1870, according to an observatory.

Armagh Observatory, one of dozens of weather stations around Northern Ireland has recorded daily rainfall at its meteorological station since 1838. It recorded a total of 195.4mm rainfall in October, exceeding the 193.8mm observed 153 years ago. County Armagh was affected by severe flooding in some areas at the end of October and start of November. The Met Office has also said county Down had its wettest October ever. As well as being the warmest October day for almost a century, the temperature of 21.7C is the third highest October temperature ever recorded at the observatory. Its director Prof Michael Burton said the data sent a clear signal. ""There's no doubt in the pattern we're all seeing - these are all evidence of the world's changing climate,"" he said. ""Essentially the extreme will become more often and so you get more hot days, more wet days, you even get cold days as well. ""But it's the extreme - it's no longer an oddity, it's a regular event that these things are happening and they're happening everywhere."" It comes as communities in counties Down, Armagh and Antrim start to assess the damage after flooding this week. While Professor Burton said no single measurement should have too much read into it, he explained that a warmer atmosphere does hold more water and that means we are likely to experience more warmer, wetter winters. ""That's physics,"" he added. When it comes to discerning climate change in action, the more evidence you can gather, the better. And more than 200 years' worth of consistent records make for a lot of evidence. It allows patterns and changes to be clearly detected. The records at Armagh Observatory show definitively that climate change is affecting our lives here and now. As well as more rainfall as the result of a warming atmosphere, the increasing temperature can also be seen in the data and these all present challenges for us to adapt to. But they are also a signal that time to mitigate the impact of climate change is running out.",376,"[""Armagh Observatory"", ""County Armagh"", ""Prof Michael Burton"", ""Met Office"", ""County Down""]","[""Armagh Observatory"", ""County Armagh"", ""Prof Michael Burton"", ""County Down""]",1clHAkWZsf5AGFHVd13wXZzrcX-7GsIL1

The Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis was due to meet Rishi Sunak in London, but No 10 cancelled the meeting at the last minute. He told reporters he was ""deeply disappointed by the abrupt cancellation"" of the meeting. Mr Mitsotakis rejected an alternative meeting with the deputy prime minister. The cancellation came a day after Mr Mitsotakis told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that the marbles should be returned, as having some of the artefacts in London and the rest in Athens was like cutting the Mona Lisa in half.  The Greek prime minister told reporters on Monday evening he was disappointed the meeting had been cancelled ""mere hours before its slated time"", saying: ""Those who firmly believe in the correctness and justice of their positions are never hesitant to engage in constructive argumentation and debate."" Mr Mitsotakis said: ""Greece and Britain share longstanding ties of friendship, and the scope of our bilateral relations is extensive.  ""Our positions on the matter of the Parthenon Sculptures are well-known. I had anticipated engaging in a discussion with my British counterpart on this issue, as well as addressing significant global challenges such as the situations in Gaza and Ukraine, the climate crisis, and migration."" Sources with knowledge of the mood in the Greek government said Mr Mitsotakis was ""baffled"" and ""annoyed"". The meeting had been due to happen at lunchtime on Tuesday and, the BBC understands, was due to last 45 minutes. But Mr Mitsotakis's appearance on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme had irritated Mr Sunak. The British government confirmed the cancellation and offered the Greek PM a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden instead. A senior Conservative source said: ""It became impossible for this meeting to go ahead following commentary regarding the Elgin Marbles prior to it.  ""Our position is clear - the Elgin Marbles are part of the permanent collection of the British Museum and belong here. It is reckless for any British politician to suggest that this is subject to negotiation."" Mr Mitsotakis met the Labour leader Keir Starmer earlier. He will now return to Greece on Tuesday after his scheduled meetings in the morning - declining the meeting with Mr Dowden. Don't underestimate the politics of this row. The Conservatives argue it was naive of Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer to meet the Greek leader, given the public view he expressed on the future of the marbles on Sunday.  Labour's view is they wouldn't stand in the way of a loan arrangement between the British Museum and Athens if one was arranged.  A spokesperson for the British government said there were ""no plans"" to change the 1963 British Museum Act - which prohibits the removal of objects from the institution's collection. But a loan does not require a change in the law and so could happen irrespective of the view of the British prime minister. Many Conservatives believe such an arrangement would be a ""slippery slope"", as one put it to me. ""Keir Starmer is clearly keen to ignore the contributions generations of British taxpayers have made to keep them safe and share them with the world,"" one party source claimed. But a Labour source said their position was long-standing - a Labour government would not change the law to allow the sculptures to be permanently moved - and Mr Sunak's behaviour was ""pathetic"". Another source said ""what a bizarre piece of culture war theatre"". A Labour spokesperson said: ""If the prime minister isn't able to meet with a European ally with whom Britain has important economic ties, this is further proof he isn't able to provide the serious economic leadership our country requires. Keir Starmer's Labour Party stands ready.""  The sculptures are arguably the most high-profile artworks in the increasingly contested debate about whether museums across the world should return items to their countries of origin. Lord Elgin, a British soldier and diplomat, removed them from the Parthenon temple in Athens in the early 19th Century. The sculptures were then bought by the British government in 1816 and placed in the British Museum. The marble figures are part of a frieze that decorated the 2,500-year old temple, made by the sculptor Phidias. The Parthenon Gallery at the Acropolis Museum was built more than a decade ago to house the sculptures. The exhibition combines the original marble sculptures with plaster copies of those held in the British Museum and other foreign museums. The trustees of the British Museum are currently exploring the prospect of a loan arrangement with Greece. The British Museum's Chair of Trustees, George Osborne, who is the former chancellor, has previously said he is looking to find ""some kind of arrangement to allow some of the sculptures to spend some of their time in Greece"". Speaking to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee in October, Mr Osborne said any deal would have to see ""objects from Greece coming here"" for the first time. It is thought any decision is at least months away.","A diplomatic row has broken out between the British and Greek governments over the Parthenon Sculptures, also known as the Elgin Marbles.

A cease-fire would be possible only if all 239 hostages held by militants in Gaza are released, Netanyahu said in a televised address.  The Israeli leader also insisted that after the war, now entering its sixth week, Gaza would be demilitarized and Israel would retain security control there. Asked what he meant by security control, Netanyahu said Israeli forces must be able to enter Gaza freely to hunt down militants.  He also rejected the idea that the Palestinian Authority, which currently administers autonomous areas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, would at some stage control Gaza. Both positions run counter to post-war scenarios floated by Israel's closest ally, the United States. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the U.S. opposes an Israeli reoccupation of Gaza and envisions a unified Palestinian government in both Gaza and the  West Bank  at some stage as a step toward Palestinian statehood.  For now, Netanyahu said, ""the war against (Hamas) is advancing with full force, and it has one goal, to win. There is no alternative to victory.""  Pressure was growing on Israel after frantic doctors at Gaza's largest hospital said the last generator had run out of fuel, causing the death of a premature baby, another child in an incubator and four other patients. Thousands of war-wounded, medical staff and displaced civilians were caught in the fighting.  In recent days, fighting near Shifa and other hospitals in northern Gaza has intensified and supplies have run out. The Israeli military has alleged, without providing evidence, that Hamas has established command posts in and underneath hospitals, using civilians as human shields. Medical staff at Shifa have denied such claims and accused Israel of harming civilians with indiscriminate attacks.  Shifa hospital director Mohammed Abu Selmia said the facility lost power Saturday.   ""Medical devices stopped. Patients, especially those in intensive care, started to die,"" he said by phone, with gunfire and explosions in the background. He said Israeli troops were ""shooting at anyone outside or inside the hospital"" and prevented movement between buildings.  The World Health Organization later said it lost communication with its contacts at Shifa, according to a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.  Israel's military confirmed clashes outside the hospital, but Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari denied Shifa was under siege. He said troops will assist Sunday in moving babies treated there and said ""we are speaking directly and regularly"" with hospital staff.  Amos Yadlin, a former head of Israeli military intelligence, told broadcaster Channel 12 that as Israel aims to crush Hamas, taking control of the hospitals would be key but require ""a lot of tactical creativity,"" without hurting patients, other civilians and Israeli hostages.  Six patients died at Shifa after the generator shut down, including the two children, spokesmen with the Hamas-run Health Ministry said.  The ""unbearably desperate situation"" at Shifa must stop now, the International Committee of the Red Cross director general, Robert Mardini, said on social media. U.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths posted that ""there can be no justification for acts of war in health care facilities.""  Elsewhere, the Palestinian Red Crescent said Israeli tanks were 20 meters (65 feet) from al-Quds hospital in Gaza City, causing ""a state of extreme panic and fear"" among the 14,000 displaced people sheltering there.  Israel's military released footage which it said showed tanks operating in Gaza. The images showed shattered buildings, some on fire, and destroyed streets empty of anyone but troops.  A 57-nation gathering of Muslim and Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia called in their communique for an end to the war in Gaza and the immediate delivery of humanitarian aid. They also called on the International Court of Justice, a U.N. organ, to open an investigation into Israel's attacks, saying the war ""cannot be called self-defense and cannot be justified under any means.""  Netanyahu has said the responsibility for any harm to civilians lies with Hamas, which denied it was preventing people in Gaza City from fleeing.  The spokesman of the Hamas military wing said militants were ambushing Israeli troops and vowed that Israel will face a long battle. The Qassam Brigades spokesman, who goes by Abu Obaida, acknowledged in audio aired on Al-Jazeera that the fight is disproportionate ""but it is terrifying the strongest force in the region.""  Israel's military has said soldiers have encountered hundreds of Hamas fighters in underground facilities, schools, mosques and clinics during the fighting. Israel has said a key goal of the war is to crush Hamas, which has ruled Gaza for 16 years.  Following Hamas' deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which at least 1,200 people were killed, Israel's allies have defended the country's right to protect itself. But now into the second month of war, there are growing differences over how Israel should conduct its fight.  The U.S. has pushed for temporary pauses that would allow for wider distribution of badly needed aid to civilians in the besieged territory where conditions are increasingly dire. However, Israel has only agreed to brief daily periods during which civilians can flee the area of ground combat in northern Gaza and head south on foot along the territory's main north-south artery.   Since these evacuation windows were first announced a week ago, more than 150,000 civilians have fled the north, according to U.N. monitors. On Saturday, the military announced a new evacuation window, saying civilians could use the central road and a coastal road.  A stream of people fled southward on the main road, some on donkey-drawn carts. One man pushed two children in a wheelbarrow.  ""Where to go, and what do they want from us?"" said Yehia al-Kafarnah, one fleeing resident.  Palestinian civilians and rights advocates have pushed back against Israel's portrayal of the southern evacuation zones as ""relatively safe."" They note that Israeli bombardment has continued across Gaza, including airstrikes in the south that Israel says target Hamas leaders but that have also killed women and children.  Demonstrations and outrage continued. Police said 300,000 Palestinian supporters marched peacefully in London, the largest such event there since the war started. Right-wing counterprotesters clashed with police.  FEAR GROWS INSIDE SHIFA ""Shelling and explosions never stopped,"" said Islam Mattar, one of thousands sheltering at Shifa. ""Children here are terrified from the constant sound of explosions.""  The Health Ministry told Al Jazeera there were still 1,500 patients at Shifa, along with 1,500 medical personnel and between 15,000 and 20,000 people seeking shelter.  Thousands have fled Shifa and other hospitals that have come under attack, but physicians said it's impossible for everyone to get out.  ""We cannot evacuate ourselves and (leave) these people inside,"" a Doctors Without Borders surgeon at Shifa, Mohammed Obeid, was quoted as saying by the organization.  CASUALTIES RISE More than 11,070 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. About 2,700 people have been reported missing and are thought to be possibly trapped or dead under the rubble.  At least 1,200 people have been killed in Israel, mainly in the initial Hamas attack, Israeli officials say. The military on Saturday confirmed the deaths of five reserve soldiers; 46 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the ground offensive began.  Nearly 240 people abducted by Hamas from Israel remain captive.  About 250,000 Israelis have been forced to evacuate from communities near Gaza and along the northern border with Lebanon, where Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants have traded fire repeatedly.  ""Hezbollah is dragging Lebanon into a possible war,"" Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said after meeting with soldiers stationed along the border.  ___  Mroue reported from Beirut.

They had just been handed over from Myanmar, the latest in scores of arrests of those accused of running scam centres in a town on the north-eastern border with China. The two were Ming Guoping and Ming Zhenzhen, son and granddaughter of one of the powerful warlords who have run the town of Laukkaing for the past 14 years.  A sudden escalation of the conflict in Myanmar has spelled the end of the Chinese mafia - the  Godfather-esque ""four families"" - in this notoriously lawless border town. At around the same time as the Chinese police released the photos of the handcuffed pair last Thursday, the official Myanmar military news published a photo of an apparent autopsy being conducted in the back of a van on the body of a 69 year-old man.  It was the warlord himself - Ming Xuechang - who, the military said, had taken his own life after being captured, an explanation greeted with scepticism by many. It was an ignominious end to an extraordinary story that began in the days of war and revolution, but turned into one of drugs, gambling, greed and Machiavellian rivalry.  Ming Xuechang was a henchman of Bai Suocheng, who heads one of the families.  Under them the remote, impoverished backwater of Laukkaing was transformed into a rowdy casino hub of gaudy high-rise towers and seedy red-light districts.  Although powerful, the Mings were not a part of this coveted list of four - the other three families were headed by Wei Chaoren, Liu Guoxi and Liu Zhengxiang. Initially developed to take advantage of Chinese demand for gambling, which is illegal in China and many other neighbouring countries, Laukkaing's casinos evolved into a lucrative front for money laundering, trafficking and in particular for dozens of scam centres.  More than 100,000 foreign nationals, many of them Chinese, were estimated to have been lured to these scam centres, where they were effectively imprisoned and forced to work long hours running sophisticated online fraud operations targeting victims all over the world. Ming Xuechang ran one of the most notorious of these scam centres, called Crouching Tiger Villa. He also reportedly ran the local police force, which, while it donned the regular uniform of the Myanmar national police, acted as little more than a private militia, one of several which enforced the rule of the four families in Laukkaing.  In September, as China ramped up pressure on all the groups running scam centres to shut them down and hand over those who worked there, the Ming family resisted. By some estimates the casinos of each family were processing several billion dollars every year. It was a huge business to give up.  The families also had close ties to the Myanmar military, and the Mings may have believed they were protected, even from the demands of China, which has long had a powerful influence in this border region. In the early hours of the morning of 20 October, a group of scam workers was being transferred from Crouching Tiger Villa, probably in anticipation of a move against the scam centre by the Chinese police.  A number of workers, reported to be between 50 and 100, tried to escape, and the scam centre guards opened fire, killing several. Some accounts say there were undercover Chinese police officers among the dead.  That prompted a strongly-worded letter from the local government office in the neighbouring Chinese province - and the announcement of arrest warrants by the Chinese police for four of the Ming family. It was China's visible frustration over the unwillingness or inability of Myanmar's ruling junta to rein in its allies in Laukkaing which encouraged three insurgent armies, calling themselves the Brotherhood Alliance, to launch their attacks against the military in late October.   China has in the past always urged restraint in order to keep the peace on its border, but its need to weed out the well-funded and well-armed families in Laukkaing appears to have changed its priorities.  The insurgents say their goal is to eliminate the scam centres, and to support the wider opposition campaign to overthrow the military regime which seized power in 2021.  But in Laukkaing the conflict is more like payback, in a vendetta which goes back to the days of the Cold War. The four families owed their control of Laukkaing to none other than Min Aung Hlaing, the military commander who led the 2021 coup and still heads the junta.  Back in 2009, Min Aung Hlaing led a military operation to oust the then-dominant warlord in Laukkaing, a veteran fighter called Peng Jiasheng.   He wanted to install allies more compliant to the needs of the then-military government, which at the time was putting pressure on all of Myanmar's ethnic insurgent groups to transform themselves into pro-government so-called border guard forces.  Most refused, including Peng, even though the military had promised in return that they would be allowed to continue making money from illegal businesses like narcotics. Peng was part of a generation of warlords in Shan State who emerged in the chaos of the post-independence years in Myanmar, when the central government's authority did not extend to most border regions.  Desperately poor, remote and infertile, Shan State's only real economy was the cultivation of opium. It became the world's largest producer, and funded the various insurgent groups. Peng began as a commander in the China-backed Burmese Communist Party, but he mutinied in 1989 as Chinese support stopped, breaking the Burmese Communist Party up into several armed insurgent groups. This was a time when the Myanmar military government was feeling vulnerable. It had just crushed a popular uprising in 1988 with great brutality - the uprising in which Aung San Suu Kyi first emerged as an opposition leader.  Worried about a possible alliance between the established ethnic insurgent groups and the opposition movement, the generals moved quickly to make peace with the insurgents, giving them a free hand to run their fiefdoms as they pleased.  Peng began developing Laukkaing as a gambling hub after being put under pressure to cut back on the narcotics business that was funding his operation. But when in 2009 he rejected the military's request to turn his forces into a border guard force, Min Aung Hlaing persuaded Bai Suocheng, Peng's  deputy-commander at the time, to rebel against him.  Peng was driven out into China. The casinos were left pockmarked by bullet-holes, although dedicated gamblers kept betting throughout the fighting. Bai and the other three families took over the casino economy.  With their close ties to the military they developed extensive business networks in Myanmar, with stakes in mining, energy, infrastructure and casinos in other countries like Cambodia. They established links with organised crime networks in Macao and south-eastern China.  Laukkaing took on the character of a Wild West boom town, where anything goes and anything can be bought and sold. There were occasional gun battles between rival scam centres, and powerful people kept lions and tigers as pets.  But much of Peng's insurgent army, the MNDAA, remained loyal to him. In 2015 he tried, and failed, to retake Laukkaing from the four families.  The MNDAA then formed an alliance with other Shan armed groups. When Peng died last year at the age of 91, he was given a lavish funeral worthy of a mafia don, attended by most of the insurgent and warlord leaders in the region. Even Min Aung Hlaing sent a senior military commander to pay his respects to his old adversary. Peng's children took over command of the MNDAA, waiting for the opportunity to oust Bai, in their eyes the usurper.  With MNDAA troops now in control of the main border crossing and all roads to Laukkaing, they are poised to retake the casino capital, the engine-room of the ""scamdemic"", as it has been dubbed by the UN.  What they do with it is anybody's guess, but having promised China to end the scams, they will need to find another way to fund their insurgency.  Their expressed goal of helping overthrow the military junta has been welcomed by the broader opposition movement.  Over the past month, millions in Myanmar have been enthralled by the triumphant scenes of ethnic insurgents parading captured soldiers and equipment, while the drama of the mafia's end has been playing out in Laukkaing. After enduring nearly three years of a violent military dictatorship, the junta looks vulnerable and people can dare to dream that it might fall.  But, given the history of serpentine shifts of loyalty in this lawless region, the MNDAA's stated aims must be viewed with caution. At the time of writing Bai Suocheng's whereabouts are unknown. It's also unclear where two of the other warlords - Wei Chaoren and Liu Zhengxiang - are currently. The fourth, Liu Guoxi, died in 2020. But many members of their families are now in Chinese custody; some have made remorseful confessions. Thousands of those working in the scam centres have already been handed over to the Chinese police. Governments in the region are trying to get hundreds more, still trapped in Laukkaing, out to safety.  The scamdemic in north-eastern Myanmar may now be over, although perhaps only to relocate to another lawless corner of the globe.

On Friday, CDS Superstores, which bought the name and website after the firm collapsed, said it would open a Wilko-branded store in Luton before Christmas. It is one of five new Wilko shops that will return to the High Street before Christmas. The others will be in Plymouth and Exeter, as well as two additional locations still to be announced. Under the plan announced by CDS Superstores, which owns The Range, former Wilko workers will be given priority when applying for the 80 jobs that are on offer per store. While it brings hope to some former Wilko staff, more than 12,000 people were made redundant when the retailer went under. Some have found new jobs, but for others it has been a struggle. The BBC spoke to four ex-workers about how they've been navigating life after Wilko Lisa Swan from Gateshead was just 17 when she started working at Wilko. Since being made redundant, the 41-year-old said she has felt depressed. ""It's like those 24 years of loyalty didn't mean anything,"" she said. Despite all the support pledged for Wilko workers, Lisa said: ""It just feels like we've been left on our own."" Poundland, which took over some Wilko shops, had pledged to prioritise former staff and told the BBC it has made more than 700 job offers. But Lisa was disappointed not to get an interview when Poundland took over her Wilko store. Lisa has been searching for full-time work but has found that many retailers are looking for part-time workers. Meanwhile, other companies don't even respond to job applications at all.  Although Lisa said she is now feeling a little more hopeful, the first few weeks of job searching after being made redundant were a challenge given she had spent nearly a quarter of a century at the same place. ""When you've done a job for such a long time, it's a hard adjustment not having work,"" she said.   ""Different things rattle through your brain, whether it's thinking you're not good enough, or wondering if you're being unrealistic in what you're trying to achieve."" Like Lisa, Matt Jonas from Canterbury hoped to benefit from some of the retailers who had offered to take on Wilko staff.   But so far, that help has failed to materialise.  ""It's interesting how when the time came, those opportunities weren't there,"" said Matt, who worked at Wilko for five years. Despite applying for a job a day, he said he's only had one face-to-face interview.  ""It feels like the job market has got much less personal,"" Matt said. ""You have these one-way interviews where you answer questions on a webcam and send the video to someone."" While navigating the jobs market, Matt is also feeling anxious about whether there is any work in retail.  ""Poundworld, where I used to work, is still an empty building five years after I was made redundant there. The Wilko building is now empty. High Street retail - I have become quite disillusioned with now.""   He describes his former colleagues at Wilko as ""like a family."" ""I keep waking up and hoping that this was all a crazy dream and I'm still working there,"" he said. ""It's crushing."" After 15 years at Wilko, Tina Bellamy from Lincolnshire was devastated about the closure. But within hours of the shop shutting, she'd been offered a new job with Poundland which was taking over the shop - as were all of her colleagues. ""We all know what we're doing, so we've just cracked on,"" she said, adding that the only new thing she's had to get used to is the uniform.  Their first task was to ready the shop - now rebranded as Poundland - for reopening within a few days. When they did, one of the best things, she said, has been customers' reactions.

The deal to create a ""loss and damage"" fund was hailed as a breakthrough for developing country negotiators at United Nations climate talks in Egypt last year, overcoming years of resistance from wealthy nations.  But in the past 11 months, governments have struggled to reach consensus on the details of the fund, such as who will pay and where the fund will be located.  A special UN committee tasked with implementing the fund met for a fifth time in Abu Dhabi this week - following a deadlock in Egypt last month - to finalise recommendations that will be put to governments when they meet for the annual climate summit COP28 in Dubai in less than four weeks' time. The goal is to get the fund up and running by 2024.  The committee, representing a geographically diverse group of countries, resolved to recommend the World Bank serve as trustee and host of the fund - a tension point that has fuelled divisions between developed and developing nations. Housing a fund at the World Bank, whose presidents are appointed by the US, would give donor countries outsized influence over the fund and result in high fees for recipient countries, developing countries have argued. To get all countries on board, it was agreed the World Bank would serve as interim trustee and host of the fund for a four-year period. Jennifer Morgan, Germany's special climate envoy, said in a post on X that Berlin ""stands ready to fulfil its responsibility - we're actively working towards contributing to the new fund and assessing options for more structural sources of financing"". Others were less optimistic. ""It is a sombre day for climate justice, as rich countries turn their backs on vulnerable communities,"" said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at nonprofit Climate Action Network International.  ""Rich countries ... have not only coerced developing nations into accepting the World Bank as the host of the Loss and Damage Fund but have also evaded their duty to lead in providing financial assistance to those communities and countries."" The committee also recommended that developed countries be urged to continue to provide support to the fund, but failed to resolve whether wealthy nations would be under strict financial obligation to do chip in. ""We regret that the text does not reflect consensus concerning the need for clarity on the voluntary nature of contributions,"" a US State Department official told Reuters. The US attempted to include a footnote clarifying that any contributions to the fund would be voluntary, but the committee chair did not allow it. The US objected to that denial. Sultan al-Jaber, who will preside over the COP28 talks, said he welcomed the committee's recommendations and that they would pave the way for an agreement at COP28.","Countries moved a step closer on Saturday to getting a fund off the ground to help poor states damaged by climate disasters, despite reservations from developing nations and the United States.

He secured significant pay raises, improved benefits, the right to strike over plant closures and a raft of other concessions. But to the United Auto Workers president, the agreements that emerged from talks that were marked by six weeks of strikes were merely the start of a victory streak and a renaissance for the 88-year-old union. Now, Fain has set his latest ambitious goal: To gain UAW membership in nonunion companies across the industry — from foreign automakers with U.S. operations like Toyota to electric vehicle makers like Tesla to EV battery plants that will likely represent a sizable share of auto jobs in the decades ahead. Already, Fain asserted in an interview with The Associated Press, the contracts have benefited workers in nonunion auto companies: Soon after the UAW won major pay raises for its workers, Toyota, Honda, Hyundai and Nissan — all nonunion operations — raised their own workers' pay in what Fain characterized as an obvious bid to stop the UAW from unionizing those workforces. Last week, workers atGeneral Motors, Ford and Stellantis collectively voted 64% to ratify the new settlement deals, which are among the richest contracts in the UAW 88-year history. The agreements ended many wage tiers, gave temporary hires better pay and a path to full-time work and boosted from around 6% to 10% the annual 401(k) contributions for those without pension plans. According to Fain, workers at some nonunion plants, including the electric vehicle sales leader, Tesla, have contacted the UAW about joining the union, which hasn't even begun its organizing efforts. Fain noted that the nonunion companies didn't raise pay for their workers until after the UAW won general and cost-of-living raises, which should reach 33% by the time the contacts expire in 2028. “Companies play their workers as fools sometimes,” he said in the interview. “They care about keeping more for themselves and leaving the employees to fend for themselves.” Fain, who took office just eight months ago in the first directelectionof UAW leaders in its history, said the time is right for labor unions to grow as they did in the 1930s and 40s, before they began a steady decline beginning in the 1950s. American workers, he said, are fed up with stagnant wages while corporate executives earn ever-growing multiples of median worker pay. Companies, Fain said, will spend “limitless amounts” to try to stop the UAW, but the union can point to its Detroit contracts to show workers they will have a voice. In that way, he said, the union is a “great equalizer."" Fain declined to say which nonunion companies the UAW would target first. But high on the list is Tesla, whose biggest shareholder is CEOElon Musk, the world's wealthiest man and an outspoken opponent of the union. “The world's richest man is the richest man for a reason,” Fain said. “They get this kind of wealth by exploiting other people.” Musk, who also runs the rocket company SpaceX, is talking about shipping Tesla production to Mexico and other low-cost countries. A message was left seeking comment from Tesla. The union leader said he expects Toyota, Honda and others to fight the UAW's organizing effort by threatening to close factories or eliminate benefits. Musk has threated to end stock awards that go to production workers if they vote to join the union. Fain said the UAW, if given the opportunity, would negotiate to retain and increase those stock awards. The union, Fain says, also will have to organize Detroit automakers' EV battery plants, which are joint ventures with South Korean companies. GM and Stellantis, the maker of Jeep and Ram vehicles, have agreed to bring their joint venture plants under the union's national contract, making it easier for the UAW to sign them up. Ford has not. That, he said, could become a problem if Ford fights the UAW's efforts to organize at the plants in Kentucky and Tennessee. “Unless they change their tune, it's going to be an all-out war,” Fain said. Ford did agree to put a wholly owned battery plant being planned for Michigan and a planned electric pickup plant in Tennessee into the UAW contract. But in the interview, Fain accused CEO Jim Farley of agreeing to work with the union on the joint-venture plants — only to renege later. “At that point, things didn't go well,” Fain said. “We had to make progress where we could, and we did.” In response, Ford said in a statement that it negotiated in good faith with the UAW and agreed to work with it on a fair deal to address the issue of union representation of the battery plants. “These are multi-billion dollar investments, and the future of our industry is in the balance, so any deal must make sustainable business sense,” the company said. Fain declined to say what his fight would look like or if it could mean a strike against Ford in 2025, when the joint-venture plants are set to open. “It just means we're going to do what we have to do to get it,” he said. “Those workers deserve their fair share of economic and social justice."" Ford has said it couldn't pledge to unionize the battery plants because its joint venture partner would have to agree and the plants aren't exclusively under its control. In addition, Ford has said, the plants haven't been built, and it can't agree to the unionization of workers who haven't been hired yet. In the contract talks, Fain said, he would have liked to gain stronger pension increases for longtime workers with defined benefit plans. He'd also like steady pension checks for newer hires rather than 401(k) plans. The union plans to seek law changes requiring “retirement security” for all workers, and will push for the benefits in 2028 contract talks. In the interview, Fain said he doesn't expect the higher costs that the automakers will absorb from the new contracts to lead them to build new factories in Mexico or Canada. The union, he said, can strike if a U.S. plant is closed and could take action if companies build new factories elsewhere. The UAW, he said, will try to work with the companies. But he noted that partnering with the automakers in the past to address costs has typically benefited them to the exclusion of workers. He noted the concessions the UAW agreed to in 2008 to help the automakers survive dire financial problems. This time, he said, union members negotiated for themselves but also won raises for nonunion workers in the South who would have received nothing without the UAW. ""That’s something to be proud of,” he said.","DETROIT --Entering contract talks with Detroit's three automakers, Shawn Fain set lofty expectations for what he could gain for his union members — and delivered on many of them.

Now, Fain has set his latest ambitious goal: To gain UAW membership in nonunion companies across the industry — from foreign automakers with U.S. operations like Toyota to electric vehicle makers like Tesla to EV battery plants that will likely represent a sizable share of auto jobs in the decades ahead. Already, Fain asserted in an interview with The Associated Press, the contracts have benefited workers in nonunion auto companies: Soon after the UAW won major pay raises for its workers, Toyota, Honda, Hyundai and Nissan — all nonunion operations — raised their own workers' pay in what Fain characterized as an obvious bid to stop the UAW from unionizing those workforces. Last week, workers atGeneral Motors, Ford and Stellantis collectively voted 64% to ratify the new settlement deals, which are among the richest contracts in the UAW 88-year history. The agreements ended many wage tiers, gave temporary hires better pay and a path to full-time work and boosted from around 6% to 10% the annual 401(k) contributions for those without pension plans. According to Fain, workers at some nonunion plants, including the electric vehicle sales leader, Tesla, have contacted the UAW about joining the union, which hasn't even begun its organizing efforts. Fain noted that the nonunion companies didn't raise pay for their workers until after the UAW won general and cost-of-living raises, which should reach 33% by the time the contacts expire in 2028. “Companies play their workers as fools sometimes,” he said in the interview. “They care about keeping more for themselves and leaving the employees to fend for themselves.” Fain, who took office just eight months ago in the first directelectionof UAW leaders in its history, said the time is right for labor unions to grow as they did in the 1930s and 40s, before they began a steady decline beginning in the 1950s. American workers, he said, are fed up with stagnant wages while corporate executives earn ever-growing multiples of median worker pay. Companies, Fain said, will spend “limitless amounts” to try to stop the UAW, but the union can point to its Detroit contracts to show workers they will have a voice. In that way, he said, the union is a “great equalizer."" Fain declined to say which nonunion companies the UAW would target first. But high on the list is Tesla, whose biggest shareholder is CEOElon Musk, the world's wealthiest man and an outspoken opponent of the union. “The world's richest man is the richest man for a reason,” Fain said. “They get this kind of wealth by exploiting other people.” Musk, who also runs the rocket company SpaceX, is talking about shipping Tesla production to Mexico and other low-cost countries. A message was left seeking comment from Tesla. The union leader said he expects Toyota, Honda and others to fight the UAW's organizing effort by threatening to close factories or eliminate benefits. Musk has threated to end stock awards that go to production workers if they vote to join the union. Fain said the UAW, if given the opportunity, would negotiate to retain and increase those stock awards. The union, Fain says, also will have to organize Detroit automakers' EV battery plants, which are joint ventures with South Korean companies. GM and Stellantis, the maker of Jeep and Ram vehicles, have agreed to bring their joint venture plants under the union's national contract, making it easier for the UAW to sign them up. Ford has not. That, he said, could become a problem if Ford fights the UAW's efforts to organize at the plants in Kentucky and Tennessee. “Unless they change their tune, it's going to be an all-out war,” Fain said. Ford did agree to put a wholly owned battery plant being planned for Michigan and a planned electric pickup plant in Tennessee into the UAW contract. But in the interview, Fain accused CEO Jim Farley of agreeing to work with the union on the joint-venture plants — only to renege later. “At that point, things didn't go well,” Fain said. “We had to make progress where we could, and we did.” In response, Ford said in a statement that it negotiated in good faith with the UAW and agreed to work with it on a fair deal to address the issue of union representation of the battery plants. “These are multi-billion dollar investments, and the future of our industry is in the balance, so any deal must make sustainable business sense,” the company said. Fain declined to say what his fight would look like or if it could mean a strike against Ford in 2025, when the joint-venture plants are set to open. “It just means we're going to do what we have to do to get it,” he said. “Those workers deserve their fair share of economic and social justice."" Ford has said it couldn't pledge to unionize the battery plants because its joint venture partner would have to agree and the plants aren't exclusively under its control. In addition, Ford has said, the plants haven't been built, and it can't agree to the unionization of workers who haven't been hired yet. In the contract talks, Fain said, he would have liked to gain stronger pension increases for longtime workers with defined benefit plans. He'd also like steady pension checks for newer hires rather than 401(k) plans. The union plans to seek law changes requiring “retirement security” for all workers, and will push for the benefits in 2028 contract talks. In the interview, Fain said he doesn't expect the higher costs that the automakers will absorb from the new contracts to lead them to build new factories in Mexico or Canada. The union, he said, can strike if a U.S. plant is closed and could take action if companies build new factories elsewhere. The UAW, he said, will try to work with the companies. But he noted that partnering with the automakers in the past to address costs has typically benefited them to the exclusion of workers. He noted the concessions the UAW agreed to in 2008 to help the automakers survive dire financial problems. This time, he said, union members negotiated for themselves but also won raises for nonunion workers in the South who would have received nothing without the UAW.

Experts explain why the push did not live up to expectations. Kyiv, Ukraine –Referring to the Soviet puzzle video game, Alla says her husband kills Russian soldiers as though he is playing “human Tetris”. “A drone hangs in the sky, and he watches [them] crawl across the forest,” she told Al Jazeera. “And he kills them. And then they crawl again.” The war in Ukraine has turned Avdiivka, where Alla’s husband is stationed, into a maze of ruins, trenches and tunnels surrounded by burned-down fields and patches of forest studded with landmines, explosion craters and remnants of Russian soldiers and armoured vehicles. Avdiivka sits 20km (12 miles) north of separatist Donetsk, wedged deep into occupied areas. Ukraine has held it since 2014. But it is nearly surrounded, and Ukrainian forces may have to leave it after weeks of bombardment with 500kg (1,100-pound) gliding bombs and storms that killed thousands on both sides. The surrender may become a sobering, pessimistic end of this year’s counteroffensive campaign, that began in June along the crescent-shaped, 1,000km-long (621-mile) front line in eastern and southern Ukraine. Last year, Ukrainian forces liberated almost 75,000 sq km (30,000 sq miles), an area the size of the United Arab Emirates, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a think tank in Washington, DC. Kyiv had said it wanted to reach the Sea of Azov to cut the “land bridge” between the Russian mainland and annexed Crimea. But Russian forces spent months building defence lines and planting thousands of landmines across no-man’s land. They also rule the air and airwaves with their planes, Lancet kamikaze drones, and radio-jamming systems that paralyse and disorient Ukrainian unmanned vehicles. Meanwhile, the F-16 fighter jets the West pledged to supply will take months to arrive – and their future pilots will spend many more months on training. So far this year, Kyiv has lost some 487 square kilometres (188 sq miles), according to a calculation by The New York Times published in late September. The results are disappointing due to several factors, military analysts say. “Strategic objectives have not been achieved this year, and it’s hardly possible” in the remaining months, Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, told Al Jazeera. He blamed Western allies for months-long delays of weaponry and a reluctance to supply more sophisticated arms. “Weaponry should be supplied on time, not the way our allies are doing it,” he said. Ukrainian “generals asked [for certain arms] a year ago, but they still didn’t supply even the types of arms that had been agreed upon.” Ukrainian top brass have long complained about the delays that Western officials say are caused by logistical hurdles. Meanwhile, the war has morphed into WWI-like positional warfare that exhausts both sides in terms of manpower and economy. “This is not our war because resources-wise, economically, Russia looks stronger and has a four-fold advantage in manpower,” Romanenko said. Russia’s population stands at 143 million, but millions of Ukrainian nationals live in annexed Crimea and other occupied areas of eastern and southern Ukraine. Ukraine’s current population is between 29 and 33 million, according to different estimates. And even though men aged 18 to 60 are not allowed to leave Ukraine, and several waves of mobilisation had hundreds of thousands drafted, heavy losses have bled Ukrainian forces dry. “Obviously, there isn’t enough manpower,” Romanenko said. He said there should be tougher measures to register all men of fighting age and classify them according to their fitness for combat. Meanwhile, some younger Ukrainians dodge the draft any way they can. “I got a summons, it was stuck in my [apartment] door,” Boris, a 21-year-old university student in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. “I have kept it there for two months so that it looks like no one lives in the apartment.” Ukraine’s commander-in-chief reportedly admitted that the counteroffensive had reached a “stalemate”. “Just like in the first world war we have reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate,” he told The Economist on November 1. “There will most likely be no deep and beautiful breakthrough.” Nikolay Mitrokhin, of Germany’s Bremen University, told Al Jazeera that Ukraine paid too dearly, with Western-supplied arms spent during “meaningless” frontal assaults on enemy lines. “A part of Western equipment burned down in meaningless attempts to break through that ended with the liberation of half a dozen ruined villages.” The counteroffensive brought with it huge casualties among Ukrainian servicemen – especially the Western-trained units that were withdrawn from the eastern towns ofBakhmutand Soledar – Russia’s last sizeable territorial gains last year. While there are no reliable official figures of casualties, tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides are understood to have been killed in the war this year. “Russian defence ground down the attack brigades that had been trained for at least six months and for whose salvation Bakhmut and Soledar were abandoned,” Mitrokhin said. Meanwhile, the Kremlin managed to avoid the collapse of Russia’s economy. “Russia has used comprehensive stimuli of investment, credit and budget – from affordable mortgages to the military-industrial complex,” Kyiv-based analyst Alexey Kushch told Al Jazeera. Moscow’s strategy of affordable credits and “replacing import” in response to Western sanctions triggered the mushrooming of domestic businesses, he said. In comparison with Russia, Ukraine’s economy is “hanging by a thread of foreign aid”, Kushch said. “There are no programmes of internal development, monetary policies are aimed at restriction of domestic credits,” he said. The economic backbone of Russia is hydrocarbon exports, and it can only be broken if the “entire world will stop buying Russian oil and gas,” said Sergey Bizyukin, an exiled opposition activist from the western city of Ryazan. “And yes, defence factories in Ryazan, where the technological base has traditionally been strong, work at a full throttle, and there’s only a lack of workforce,” he told Al Jazeera. But regardless of how small Kyiv’s gains are, they “shouldn’t be underestimated” – in the words of Rybar, a pro-Russian Telegram channel with 1.2m subscribers. Ukrainian forces are expanding their toehold on the left bank of the Dnipro river in the southern Kherson region, a gateway to Crimea, it said. Supported by swarms of drones, Ukrainians ferried armoured vehicles and some 300 servicemen to the village of Krynki earlier this month, Rybar said. “Krynki is ours,” Ukrainian war veteran Yevgen Dikyi said in televised remarks.

The White House has said for weeks that it anticipated Biden and Xi would meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco, but negotiations went down to the eve of the gathering, which kicks off Saturday. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement the leaders would discuss the “continued importance of maintaining open lines of communication” and how the they “can continue to responsibly manage competition and work together where our interests align, particularly on transnational challenges that affect the international community.” China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement Friday that Xi would attend APEC from Tuesday to Friday at Biden’s invitation and would take part in the U.S.-China summit. Two senior Biden administration officials, who earlier briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said the leaders would meet in the San Francisco Bay area but declined to offer further details because of security concerns. Thousands of protesters are expected to descend on San Francisco during the summit. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng met for a second day of talks on Friday  in San Francisco, the latest in a string of senior level engagements between the nations in recent months aimed at easing tensions. Yellen said that during the talks she emphasized that the U.S. seeks a healthy economic relationship withChina. She called on China to crack down on private Chinese firms and financial institutions that the U.S. believes are skirting international sanction to do business with Russia and she raised concerns about Chinese export controls on graphite in other critical minerals. Graphite is a key raw material in electric vehicle batteries. Yellen, who visited China in July, said she accepted an invitation to make a return trip to Beijing next year. “There is no substitute for in-person diplomacy,” said Yellen, who added that she believed the two laid the groundwork for a productive meeting between Biden and Xi. “During our discussions, we agreed in-depth and frank discussions matter, particularly when we disagree.” The Biden-Xi meeting is not expected to lead to many, if any, major announcements, and differences between the two powers certainly won't be resolved. Instead, one official said, Biden is looking toward “managing the competition, preventing the downside risk of conflict and ensuring channels of communication are open.” The officials said they believed it would be Xi's first visit to San Francisco since he was a young Communist Party leader. The agenda includes no shortage of difficult issues. Differences in the already complicated U.S.-Chinese relationship have only sharpened in the last year, with Beijing bristling over new U.S. export controls on advanced technology; Biden ordering the shooting down of a Chinese spy balloon after it traversed the continental United States; and Chinese anger over a stopover in the U.S. by Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen earlier this year, among other issues. China claims the island as its territory. Biden will also likely press Xi on using China's influence on North Korea, during heightened anxiety over an increased pace of ballistic missile tests by North Korea as well as Pyongyang providing munitions to Russia for its war inUkraine. The Democratic president is also expected to let Xi know that he would like China to use its burgeoning sway over Iran to make clear that Tehran or its proxies should not take action that could lead to expansion of the Israel-Hamas war. His administration believes the Chinese, a big buyer of Iranian oil, have considerable leverage with Iran, which is a major backer of Hamas. Biden and Xi last met nearly a year ago on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit inBali, Indonesia. In the nearly three-hour meeting, Biden objected directly to China’s ”coercive and increasingly aggressive actions” toward Taiwan and discussed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other issues. Xi stressed that ""the Taiwan question is at the very core of China’s core interests, the bedrock of the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-U.S. relations.” The Chinese foreign ministry said this time Biden and Xi would focus on “in-depth communications on the strategic, overall and directional issues of the China-US relations as well as major issues concerning world peace and development."" Next week's meeting comes as the United States braces for a potentially bumpy year for U.S.-Chinese relations, with Taiwan set to hold a presidential election in January and the U.S. holding its own presidential election next November. Beijing sees official American contact with Taiwan as encouragement to make the island’s decades-old de facto independence permanent, a step U.S. leaders say they don’t support. Under the “One China” policy, the U.S. recognizes Beijing as the government of China and doesn’t have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but it has maintained that Taipei is an important partner in the Indo-Pacific. Biden intends to reaffirm the U.S. wants no change in the status quo, one official said. Disinformation experts testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee have warned that Beijing could aim to target the U.S., sowing discord that might influence election results at the local level, especially in districts with large numbers of Chinese-American voters. The Biden administration has sought to make clear to the Chinese that any actions or interference in the 2024 election “would raise extremely strong concerns from our side,” according to one official. The officials also noted that Biden is determined to restore military-to-military communications that Beijing largely withdrew from after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August 2022. All the while, the number of unsafe or provocative encounters involving the two nations’ ships and aircraft have spiked. Last month, the U.S. military released a video of a Chinese fighter jet flying within 10 feet (3 meters) of an American B-52 bomber over the South China Sea, nearly causing an accident.

Gen. CQ Brown Jr., the top U.S. military commander, told reporters in Tokyo on Friday that restoration of military-to-military contacts is “hugely important” to “ensure there is no miscalculation” between the sides. He said he conveyed his desire to restart the dialogue in a letter to his Chinese counterpart. The officials also said Biden would underscore U.S. commitment to the Philippines, following a recent episode in which Chinese ships blocked and collided with two Filipino vessels off a contested shoal in the South China Sea. The Philippines and other neighbors of China are resisting Beijing’s sweeping territorial claims over virtually the entire sea. “I want to be very clear,” Biden said in October. ""The United States’ defense commitment to the Philippines is iron clad.” Both sides appeared to be carefully considering security for the meeting, declining to publicize the venue of the much-anticipated talks.

The White House has said for weeks that it anticipated Biden and Xi would meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco, but negotiations went down to the eve of the gathering, which kicks off Saturday. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement the leaders would discuss the “continued importance of maintaining open lines of communication” and how the they “can continue to responsibly manage competition and work together where our interests align, particularly on transnational challenges that affect the international community.” China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement Friday that Xi would attend APEC from Tuesday to Friday at Biden’s invitation and would take part in the U.S.-China summit. Two senior Biden administration officials, who earlier briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said the leaders would meet in the San Francisco Bay area but declined to offer further details because of security concerns. Thousands of protesters are expected to descend on San Francisco during the summit. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng met for a second day of talks on Friday  in San Francisco, the latest in a string of senior level engagements between the nations in recent months aimed at easing tensions. Yellen said that during the talks she emphasized that the U.S. seeks a healthy economic relationship withChina. She called on China to crack down on private Chinese firms and financial institutions that the U.S. believes are skirting international sanction to do business with Russia and she raised concerns about Chinese export controls on graphite in other critical minerals.

Russia has declined to comment on US claims that Iran could supply it with ballistic missiles. Ukraine said it shot down a “rare” Iran-built drone amid a barrage of attacks overnight. The Ukrainian Air Force said on Wednesday that it had downed more than a dozen attack drones and a cruise missile. The overnight assault followed a report by authorities in the southern region of Odesa that a rare Iranian-designed attack and reconnaissance drone had been destroyed. The air force said the overnight barrage was launched from southeast Russia and that a combination of air defence units in several central regions had “destroyed all 14 enemy Shahed-131/136 drones”. “The X-22 cruise missile failed to reach its target and landed in Zaporizhia region in an open area, and the blast wave damaged private homes. There were no casualties,” it added in a statement. Ukraine has been bracing for an increase in Russian attacks on critical infrastructure – particularly energy facilities – as subzero temperatures set in. Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure last winter left many in the cold and dark for long periods. Kyiv has since received more air defence systems from its allies. Authorities in the Odesa region said on Tuesday that they had downed a “rare” Mohajer-6 drone. “The reconnaissance and strike UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] was sneaking up on the Odesa region,” city officials said. The statement on social media said Russia had purchased 30 of the drones last year and that air defence forces shot one down for the first time last September. The Mohajer-6 is designed for reconnaissance and attack, can carry four guided missiles and has a range of up to 200km (124 miles) over 12 hours, the statement added. Iran’s support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has long disturbed the US. The Kremlin declined on Wednesday to comment on a suggestion by White House spokesperson John Kirby that Iran may be considering providing Russia with ballistic missiles for use in its war. “We are developing relations with Iran, including in the field of military-technical cooperation, but we do not comment on this information,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about the accusation.

More than 60 years ago he made the first ever descent to the deepest place in the ocean, the Mariana Trench which lies almost 11km (seven miles) down. I was lucky enough to count him as a good friend. This is the story of an extraordinary dive by a remarkable man. In 1960, space-mania was gripping the world and would-be astronauts were dreaming of their first forays skywards.  But 28-year-old Captain Don Walsh had his sights set very much downwards. He was about to descend deeper than any human had ever ventured before. The US Navy had acquired a submersible called the bathyscaphe Trieste and Don, a submarine lieutenant, volunteered to join the project. But when he signed up for the mission, the deepest he'd been in a sub was just 100m down. He was in for a bit of a shock - the US Navy wanted him to dive more than a hundred times deeper.  The plan was to head to the deepest place on the planet, the very bottom of the Mariana Trench, a narrow, underwater canyon, which lies in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Guam.  ""My first reaction was 'What!? Why didn't they tell me before I volunteered?'"" he told me in an interview in 2011.  ""After that, I thought: 'Well, I knew the machine well enough at that point to know that, theoretically, it could be done and we could pull it off.'"" On 23 January, 1960, Don and Swiss oceanographer Jacques Piccard, who had designed the bathyscaphe with his father Auguste Piccard, began their descent beneath the waves. They squeezed inside a thick steel-walled chamber. Don said the space was about the size of a large household refrigerator, and that the temperature inside was just about as cold too. As the pair plunged slowly into the darkness, the craft began to creak and groan as the pressure grew. The bathyscaphe had been built to withstand more than 1,000 times the pressure at sea level, but it had never been tested to its limits at these kinds of depths until now. The start of the dive went smoothly, but at around 9,000m, the bathyscaphe jolted with an alarming bang. ""That was unusual - we'd never heard that before,"" Don later told me. It sounded like something big had broken. Don and Jacques carefully checked their instrument readings, but everything seemed OK, so they decided to go on. After five hours, slowly heading ever deeper, the depth-gauge passed 10,000m - but there was still no sign of the sea floor.  They began to wonder just how far down they would have to go. But finally, the glow of the bathyscaphe's lights began to reflect back towards them. Don and Jacques had made it: at almost 11km (seven miles) down, they were at the very bottom of the Mariana Trench. ""After we landed, we stirred up a lot of sediment because that bottom sediment is semi-liquid,"" Don said.  ""It was like looking at a bowl of milk - so we never got a photograph of the deepest place in the ocean.""  There weren't any whoops or cheers at the end of this epic, record-breaking descent. ""It was just a quiet moment,"" Don recalled.  The pair spent about 20 minutes on the seafloor. While inspecting the craft they discovered the source of the bang they'd heard earlier. An acrylic window inside the entrance hatch had cracked. Thankfully it wasn't a pressure boundary - if that had been the case it would have caused an instant implosion.  They were able to make it safely back to the surface.  The team had made history, receiving the Legion of Merit from US President Dwight D. Eisenhower among other medals and plaudits.  For Don, the dive came to partly define him - he used to quip that he'd spent the rest of his life ""dining out"" on it.  But deep-sea devotees - myself included - wanted to know about his visit to one of the most mysterious parts of the planet.  And being generous - as well as very funny and humble too - he was always happy to tell the incredible tale.  But Don wasn't stuck in the past. Far from it.  His dive was just the start of a life spent advocating for the ocean, and supporting those who wanted to explore and learn about the deep.  After the navy, he became a professor of ocean engineering, he also set up a marine consultancy business and was a strong advocate for safety within the industry.  He forewarned of the Titan tragedy - the submersible that imploded on its way to the Titanic, killing all six people on board. Years before, he had written to the company's CEO warning that the lack of testing of the sub could have catastrophic consequences.   In later life, it was the Mariana Trench that grabbed his attention once again.  After Don completed his dive in 1960, he thought it would only be a couple of years before someone would return. In fact, it would be more than half a century. In 2012, Hollywood filmmaker and ocean explorer James Cameron became the first to repeat the dive. Don was there to congratulate him after he resurfaced from his solo descent.  Don returned to the Pacific once again in 2019 when former American naval officer and explorer Victor Vescovo took the plunge.  Victor went on to take his sub to ocean trenches around the world - and with an extra seat on board, he could carry passengers.  One of these was Don's son Kelly Walsh. Don told me that Kelly's Mariana dive was the best Father's Day gift he'd ever had - and he loved that Kelly had made it 8m deeper than he had.  Ocean and space exploration are frequently compared, and Don often joked that he had the ""Right Stuff"", just in the wrong direction. He was talking about the fabled qualities - courage, daring and dependability - that made astronauts the stuff of legend. And it's true. Don had these attributes in spades.  But it's fair to say the Mariana dive never attracted the same attention as the achievements of astronauts from the same era.  Today though, I'm not so sure that Don's focus on the ocean could be described as the wrong direction. Recent advances in technology mean that we're finally understanding the importance of the deepest sea.  While the ocean trenches were once thought of as desolate places, of little interest apart from their depth, it turns out that they're a vital part of the Earth's systems, from the weird and wonderful creatures that live there, to the important role they play in the carbon cycle and climate change. None of this would have been possible without Don and Jacques Piccard's incredible feat so long ago.  The DNA from their dive runs right through this new era of research - it took a plunge into the unknown to start shedding light on what lies beyond the abyss.

They squeezed inside a thick steel-walled chamber. Don said the space was about the size of a large household refrigerator, and that the temperature inside was just about as cold too. As the pair plunged slowly into the darkness, the craft began to creak and groan as the pressure grew. The bathyscaphe had been built to withstand more than 1,000 times the pressure at sea level, but it had never been tested to its limits at these kinds of depths until now. The start of the dive went smoothly, but at around 9,000m, the bathyscaphe jolted with an alarming bang. ""That was unusual - we'd never heard that before,"" Don later told me. It sounded like something big had broken. Don and Jacques carefully checked their instrument readings, but everything seemed OK, so they decided to go on. After five hours, slowly heading ever deeper, the depth-gauge passed 10,000m - but there was still no sign of the sea floor.  They began to wonder just how far down they would have to go. But finally, the glow of the bathyscaphe's lights began to reflect back towards them. Don and Jacques had made it: at almost 11km (seven miles) down, they were at the very bottom of the Mariana Trench. ""After we landed, we stirred up a lot of sediment because that bottom sediment is semi-liquid,"" Don said.  ""It was like looking at a bowl of milk - so we never got a photograph of the deepest place in the ocean.""  There weren't any whoops or cheers at the end of this epic, record-breaking descent. ""It was just a quiet moment,"" Don recalled.  The pair spent about 20 minutes on the seafloor. While inspecting the craft they discovered the source of the bang they'd heard earlier. An acrylic window inside the entrance hatch had cracked. Thankfully it wasn't a pressure boundary - if that had been the case it would have caused an instant implosion.  They were able to make it safely back to the surface.  The team had made history, receiving the Legion of Merit from US President Dwight D. Eisenhower among other medals and plaudits.  For Don, the dive came to partly define him - he used to quip that he'd spent the rest of his life ""dining out"" on it.  But deep-sea devotees - myself included - wanted to know about his visit to one of the most mysterious parts of the planet.  And being generous - as well as very funny and humble too - he was always happy to tell the incredible tale.  But Don wasn't stuck in the past. Far from it.  His dive was just the start of a life spent advocating for the ocean, and supporting those who wanted to explore and learn about the deep.  After the navy, he became a professor of ocean engineering, he also set up a marine consultancy business and was a strong advocate for safety within the industry.  He forewarned of the Titan tragedy - the submersible that imploded on its way to the Titanic, killing all six people on board. Years before, he had written to the company's CEO warning that the lack of testing of the sub could have catastrophic consequences.   In later life, it was the Mariana Trench that grabbed his attention once again.  After Don completed his dive in 1960, he thought it would only be a couple of years before someone would return. In fact, it would be more than half a century. In 2012, Hollywood filmmaker and ocean explorer James Cameron became the first to repeat the dive. Don was there to congratulate him after he resurfaced from his solo descent.  Don returned to the Pacific once again in 2019 when former American naval officer and explorer Victor Vescovo took the plunge.  Victor went on to take his sub to ocean trenches around the world - and with an extra seat on board, he could carry passengers.  One of these was Don's son Kelly Walsh. Don told me that Kelly's Mariana dive was the best Father's Day gift he'd ever had - and he loved that Kelly had made it 8m deeper than he had.  Ocean and space exploration are frequently compared, and Don often joked that he had the ""Right Stuff"", just in the wrong direction. He was talking about the fabled qualities - courage, daring and dependability - that made astronauts the stuff of legend. And it's true. Don had these attributes in spades.  But it's fair to say the Mariana dive never attracted the same attention as the achievements of astronauts from the same era.  Today though, I'm not so sure that Don's focus on the ocean could be described as the wrong direction. Recent advances in technology mean that we're finally understanding the importance of the deepest sea.  While the ocean trenches were once thought of as desolate places, of little interest apart from their depth, it turns out that they're a vital part of the Earth's systems, from the weird and wonderful creatures that live there, to the important role they play in the carbon cycle and climate change. None of this would have been possible without Don and Jacques Piccard's incredible feat so long ago.  The DNA from their dive runs right through this new era of research - it took a plunge into the unknown to start shedding light on what lies beyond the abyss.

There are online communities who view them as beautiful, but there's concern local resistance could hamper the government's plans to build a huge number of new power lines as the country moves towards greater use of renewable power.  In a bid to counter opposition, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is expected to announce that households living close to new pylons and electricity substations could get up to £1,000 a year off their energy bills.  But could communities feel more favourable to pylons if they had a different look? Some design companies have had a go at providing alternatives.  Back in 2008, US-based architects Choi + Shine came up with the idea of making pylons that look like huge human sculptures - a project entitled Land of Giants. Jin Choi explains she had the idea when she and Thomas Shine were driving to Montreal.  ""There were miles of pylons running next to the road - I thought they were like a hybrid between real giants and insects.  ""It feels as though it is not you who are moving - they are the ones that are moving, like they are approaching you."" After seeing her sketches, Thomas was instantly captivated by the idea: ""Once someone shows it to you, you can't unsee it."" The pair argue there is no reason why infrastructure shouldn't be attractive.  ""When someone designs a bridge it is accepted it should be beautiful, when someone builds a power station no-one thinks it should be beautiful,"" says Thomas.  Despite winning a competition run by an Icelandic power company, their pylon giants have yet to be built anywhere in the world. The designers say the issue isn't necessarily one of cost, pointing out that their pylons are made out of the same material as a regular pylon, simply put together in a different way.  They add that there can be political wrangling over who gets to have one of the pylons in their area.  A proposal in Norway faltered after a local mayor - spotting the visitor attraction potential of the structures - agreed they could be built in his town, as long as they weren't built anywhere else in the country.  The designs have also been considered in New Mexico, Georgia and Chile. Jin acknowledges she has some frustration that, despite plenty of attention, the designs have not so far been constructed. ""Of course it is difficult, I wouldn't pretend it isn't, but it is better than no interest. ""I've started calling it the burden of dreams - the price to pay to have this privilege to keep dreaming."" Others have also tried to improve the look of pylons. In 2010 artists transformed a pylon in Essen, Germany: Maybe if you can't ""beautify"" infrastructure, the answer lies in trying to camouflage it. Last year, telecoms company Three built a phone mast in South Queensferry, Scotland which was designed to look like a tree. A spokesperson for Three said that, having consulted with the local community, they decided a mast in the style of a tree would ""coordinate with the broader surroundings"".  The planning application attracted some complaints, with one local arguing the structure looked ""utterly ridiculous"" and another saying it would be ""inconceivable that this will blend in"".  Disguising every pylon in the country would likely be expensive and impractical; however the National Grid has made efforts to change the traditional design of a pylon into something less obtrusive.  In 2011, along with the Royal Institute of British Architects, it launched a competition to find a new model of pylon - the first major redesign since 1927.  The eventual winner was Danish architect Bystrup, with a giant T design with two diamonds hanging off either end.  The structure means the height of the pylon is reduced by a third, compared to traditional models, as well as being quicker to put up. The first of these models were built and energised earlier this year between Bridgwater and Loxton in Somerset. Local residents have compared the new structures to, among other things, Pat Butcher from EastEnders' earrings, MC Hammer and a contraceptive coil. The National Grid says it received more than 11,000 pieces of feedback about the pylons and most people expressed a preference for T-pylons over the lattice versions.  Another alternative to making pylons more amenable to the local population is to incentivise people. It has already been tried in Ireland where people living within 200m of a new overhead line or transmission station can get €2,000-30,000, depending on how close they are, and the capacity of the line. And earlier this year, energy expert Nick Winser in his report for the UK government recommended this approach.  He argued that the cost of compensation would be lower than building cables underground which costs between five and 10 times more than overhead lines.  The government appears to have accepted this recommendation, with the chancellor expected to set out details on Wednesday in his Autumn Statement. But, maybe instead of making pylons prettier and smaller, disguising them as trees, or paying people to put up with them, it would be cheaper and easier to simply learn to love the pylon for what it is.  Kevin Mosedale - founder of the slightly tongue-in-cheek Pylon of the Month blog - says he can understand why people might not want to live near the structures. However, he argues they can be beautiful ""in their own way"" and uses his blog to celebrate them. They have, he says quoting architectural writer Jonathan Glancey, a ""gaunt skeletal beauty"".

A spokesperson for Jordan, R-Ohio, told ABC News, ""Chairman Jordan never saw or heard of any abuse, and if he had, he would have dealt with it."" The allegations of abuse were against Dr. Richard Strauss, an Ohio State team doctor and sports medicine researcher. Strauss is accused of sexually abusing at least 177 men over an 18-year period from 1979 to 1997 -- nearly his entire time at Ohio State,according to an independent report released in 2019. Investigators determined that university officials ignored nearly two decades of accusations of sexual abuse against Strauss, who killed himself in 2006 at age 67, seven years after retiring from the university. The accusations of abuse involved athletes from at least 16 sports including wrestling, hockey and swimming, and included Strauss' work at the student health center and an off-campus clinic that he founded late in his tenure, according to the report.  The university removed Strauss as a school physician in 1996 after a flurry of student complaints and reported his actions to the State Medical Board of Ohio. However, the school allowed Strauss to retain his tenured faculty position while he operated an off-campus clinic, where the report says he continued to abuse students. Ohio State University has since admitted that it failed to protect students from Strauss, paying out $60 million in settlements to some 296 victims. Jordan, who was an assistant coach on the team from 1986 to 1994,came under fire in 2018when several former OSU wrestlers took their allegations against Strauss to themediaand claimed Jordan was aware of Strauss' inappropriate behavior and failed to report it.

Saraswat, who is heading a committee to explore the technological and commercial viability of the  Virgin Hyperloop  technology, further said some foreign companies have shown interest to bring the technology in India.   ""Hyperloop technology as far as we are concerned, we found that the offer which came from foreign countries are not very viable options. They are at a very low level of maturity of technology,"" he told PTI in an interview.   Hyperloop is a high-speed train, running in vacuum in a tube. The technology is proposed  Elon Musk , who is behind electric car company  Tesla  and commercial space transport company SpaceX.   ""So we have not given much importance to that and as on today, it is only a study programme. I don't expect hyperloop to enter into our transportation framework in the near future,"" he said.   The Virgin Hyperloop test run was conducted on November 9, 2020, on a 500-metre track in Las Vegas in the US with a pod, as the hyperloop vehicles are called, travelling with passengers, including an Indian, inside an enclosed tube at more than 161 km/hr.   According to Saraswat, the offers which came are at a very low level of maturity and ""we can not make investment on that kind of a technology.""   Virgin Hyperloop is among a handful of companies which are trying to build such a system for passenger travel.    Maharashtra  has deemed hyperloop a public infrastructure exercise and approved the Virgin Hyperloop-DP World Consortium as the original project proponent for the Mumbai-Pune hyperloop project.   Replying to a question on India's reliance on lithium imports from China, Saraswat said as on today, production of lithium ion battery in India is very low, so the dependence is on the import of batteries from China and other sources.   ""But mostly it is from China because competition wise the Chinese batteries are cheaper,"" he said.   Pointing out that India has given incentives for setting up battery manufacturing facilities in the country, Saraswat said,""Hopefully, next year you will have couple of business houses going into production in a large scale for manufacturing of lithium-ion battery in the country.""   About 75 per cent of the lithium-ion imports come from China.   On reports of India talking to Chile and Bolivia for tapping into lithium mining, Saraswat said there was a suggestion that India should go for acquisition of certain mining facilities in Chile, Argentina and other places.   ""And what has happened is instead of the government directly going to these countries and acquiring mines , our private sector has already signed business to business agreement with some of the companies in these countries and they have already got supply chain agreement for getting lithium from these centres.""   Chile endowed with most lithium reserves, is the second largest global lithium producer.   To a query on the government promoting methanol as alternative fuel, Saraswat said,""we have been able to complete our trials of blending 15 per methanol in diesel.""

That's more than Russia's entire national debt. For two years, the company has been lurching from crisis to crisis, repeatedly failing to make payments on its multi-billion dollar loans. Now its founder is under police surveillance, its shares are practically worthless and more than a million people in China are still waiting for their homes to be completed. On Monday, a court in Hong Kong could open a new chapter in the crisis by ordering the liquidation of some of Evergrande assets to pay back frustrated foreign investors. Evergrande has become the poster child of China's flailing real estate sector. Its name, along with other major developers such as Country Garden, has become associated with unsustainable debt and impending financial disaster. Yet, Evergrande clings to survival. In most Western countries, a failing privately-owned business such as Evergrande would either be liquidated or, in extreme cases, bailed out by the government. But things are done differently in China. The world's second-largest economy is neither capitalist nor communist. It is unique, which makes it hard to predict Evergrande's fate. But for now, Beijing has eased pressure on the firm in ways other countries cannot. ""It's alive only because the government hasn't let it die,"" says Leland Miller, chief executive of China Beige Book, an analytical platform that tracks the Chinese marketplace.  Unlike Western countries, China is not a free market. When a problem arises, Mr Miller explains, the state can simply move tidal waves of money to patch it up. The majority of the money Evergrande owes is to creditors in China, including ordinary homeowners, suppliers and banks. And the government's control over them is key to explaining the company's zombie-like state. ""The banking system in China is still almost exclusively state-run,"" says Dexter Roberts, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. ""So if Beijing tells those banks to find a way to roll over the debt, then they're going to do that. Ultimately, they answer to the state and they're well aware of that.""  Mr Miller agrees: ""The Chinese state can order lenders to lend, suppliers to supply, borrowers to borrow. Evergrande is neither dead nor alive, but in this system it doesn't really matter."" Not all of Evergrande's creditors are Chinese. A small group of frustrated lenders outside of China have scheduled a court hearing in Hong Kong on 30 October. A judge could order a liquidation of company assets to be distributed to these foreign creditors. However, this would be unprecedented in scale and complexity. And it would almost certainly need the approval of Chinese authorities.  So what happens to Evergrande? Some analysts say that China's leadership is yet to decide. ""A lot of the Chinese system is still modelled on the Soviet Union and there were no bankruptcies in the Soviet Union,"" says Logan Wright, director of China Market Research at Rhodium Group. ""You have to remember that Western capitalism has had a long time to establish a process for failed companies and how you manage their debts. In China, there isn't the same kind of template."" The Chinese government could let Evergrande collapse. But, according to Mr Roberts, Beijing would then have to clean up the mess, which would be a huge political headache. The knock-on effects for local governments - which rely on land sales - suppliers and banks would be ""potentially catastrophic"", he added. Other analysts argue that Evergrande's collapse, if it were to happen, could hurt the future of the Communist Party itself. ""Social stability is at stake,"" says Shitong Qiao, an expert in Chinese property law at Duke University in the US. ""A collapse would not just leave many Chinese banks with bad debt, it would also leave hundreds of thousands of Chinese homebuyers without an apartment that they have paid for."" On more than one occasion, there have been chaotic scenes at Evergrande's headquarters in Shenzhen, when protesters scolded executives and home buyers demanded refunds on their purchases. Last year, many of them joined a mortgage strike until their homes were completed. A collapse could shatter confidence in the housing market, plunging prices further. That would leave people noticeably poorer in a country where they invest their life-savings in new homes. And it would be a blow to an already sluggish economy - the property sector accounts for a quarter of it.  All of this could lead to more public anger and even instability. And that is perhaps the biggest threat to the Party, whose grip on power has long been bolstered by China's prosperity.    Does that mean Evergrande is - to borrow a Western phrase - ""too big to fail"". It is tempting to draw parallels with the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008, which saw the collapse of Wall Street investment giant Lehman Brothers and a global recession. Back then failing banks and institutions around the world were bailed out by their governments and central banks. But China is different. Its financial system is not as enmeshed with the property sector as it is in the US. And Beijing, which has firm control over money flows, seems in no rush to bail out Evergrande.  ""The system is designed to ensure that an acute crisis will always be very unlikely,"" Mr Miller says. ""It's not susceptible to a western-style 'Lehman moment'"". A bailout would also not fit with the ideology of China's leadership. In fact, some argue that the Party deliberately triggered Evergrande's decline because the firm's success relied on a flawed economic model.  Evergrande's rise was fuelled by heavy borrowing to build houses for middle-class Chinese looking to make money from property. But property developers borrowed too much money to build too many houses that not enough people want to buy. ""This is not a sustainable economic model and the government knew this,"" Mr Roberts says.  This ""investment-led growth"" - or building for building's sake - drove China's rise well before Xi Jinping came to power in 2012. But over time the Party's refrain, encouraged by Mr Xi, became ""houses are for living in, not for speculation"". Things came to a head in 2020 when the government, fearing a bubble in the property market, introduced new financial regulatory guidelines, known as its ""three red lines"". They severely restricted developers' ability to borrow more money, eventually causing the crisis that has mired Evergrande and the rest of China's property sector.  For China's leaders, the painful but necessary measure was the only way to rein in unsustainable debt. Except they didn't anticipate how much worse it would get, especially as China's economy took a hit from sweeping zero-Covid lockdowns.  ""But still, bailing out Evergrande now would effectively make a mockery of everything the government is trying to do in terms of de-leveraging the sector and changing the economy,"" Mr Roberts says.  Mr Wright agrees it would be seen as a backward step: ""What kind of signal are you sending to the rest of the industry if you bail out Evergrande?"" In other words, China's leadership is stuck. A collapse would be disastrous and a bailout would be ideologically untenable. ""This may be a contrarian view - but I absolutely believe Beijing has a strategy here,"" Mr Miller says. ""For years foreign investors have lectured Beijing that it needs to stop relying on artificially high levels of growth driven by property sector borrowing. Now that the Party is finally doing that - it was never going to be a painless process."" What new model Mr Xi, who has increasingly centralised power in his hands, wants is unclear.  At last year's Party Congress, when he secured a historic third term as leader, he warned against continuing China's ""unsustainable"" economic model, driven by what he calls ""money worship"" and ""vested interests"". Rebuking the dangers of unfettered capitalism, he said: ""The leadership of the Communist Party of China is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics."" Amid the chaos of Evergrande, the arrest of its billionaire founder and chairman Hui Ka Yan reinforced the idea that the Party, rather than private businessmen, is still firmly in charge. According to Mr Miller, China is consciously paying the price for ""gross economic mismanagement"", but its continued grip over the economy suggests it has a plan.  But others insist that is not so clear. ""Capitalism is a profit and loss system,"" Mr Wright says. ""It will be interesting to see how China deals with the losses part"".","The Chinese property developer Evergrande owes more than $325bn (£269bn). That's more than Russia's entire national debt. For two years, the company has been lurching from crisis to crisis, repeatedly failing to make payments on its multi-billion dollar loans. Now its founder is under police surveillance, its shares are practically worthless and more than a million people in China are still waiting for their homes to be completed. On Monday, a court in Hong Kong could open a new chapter in the crisis by ordering the liquidation of some of Evergrande assets to pay back frustrated foreign investors. Evergrande has become the poster child of China's flailing real estate sector. Its name, along with other major developers such as Country Garden, has become associated with unsustainable debt and impending financial disaster. Yet, Evergrande clings to survival. In most Western countries, a failing privately-owned business such as Evergrande would either be liquidated or, in extreme cases, bailed out by the government. But things are done differently in China. The world's second-largest economy is neither capitalist nor communist. It is unique, which makes it hard to predict Evergrande's fate. But for now, Beijing has eased pressure on the firm in ways other countries cannot. ""It's alive only because the government hasn't let it die,"" says Leland Miller, chief executive of China Beige Book, an analytical platform that tracks the Chinese marketplace.  Unlike Western countries, China is not a free market. When a problem arises, Mr Miller explains, the state can simply move tidal waves of money to patch it up. The majority of the money Evergrande owes is to creditors in China, including ordinary homeowners, suppliers and banks. And the government's control over them is key to explaining the company's zombie-like state. ""The banking system in China is still almost exclusively state-run,"" says Dexter Roberts, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. ""So if Beijing tells those banks to find a way to roll over the debt, then they're going to do that. Ultimately, they answer to the state and they're well aware of that.""  Mr Miller agrees: ""The Chinese state can order lenders to lend, suppliers to supply, borrowers to borrow. Evergrande is neither dead nor alive, but in this system it doesn't really matter."" Not all of Evergrande's creditors are Chinese. A small group of frustrated lenders outside of China have scheduled a court hearing in Hong Kong on 30 October. A judge could order a liquidation of company assets to be distributed to these foreign creditors. However, this would be unprecedented in scale and complexity. And it would almost certainly need the approval of Chinese authorities.  So what happens to Evergrande? Some analysts say that China's leadership is yet to decide. ""A lot of the Chinese system is still modelled on the Soviet Union and there were no bankruptcies in the Soviet Union,"" says Logan Wright, director of China Market Research at Rhodium Group. ""You have to remember that Western capitalism has had a long time to establish a process for failed companies and how you manage their debts. In China, there isn't the same kind of template."" The Chinese government could let Evergrande collapse. But, according to Mr Roberts, Beijing would then have to clean up the mess, which would be a huge political headache. The knock-on effects for local governments - which rely on land sales - suppliers and banks would be ""potentially catastrophic"", he added. Other analysts argue that Evergrande's collapse, if it were to happen, could hurt the future of the Communist Party itself. ""Social stability is at stake,"" says Shitong Qiao, an expert in Chinese property law at Duke University in the US. ""A collapse would not just leave many Chinese banks with bad debt, it would also leave hundreds of thousands of Chinese homebuyers without an apartment that they have paid for.""

The Indian passenger vehicle market is expected to carry forward the momentum of this year to the next purely driven by economic fundamentals, having already moved beyond pent-up demand-induced growth, according to  Toyota Kirloskar Motor  Executive Vice President & Country Head  Vikram Gulati .

He further said, ""Going forward, I think the fundamentals are good. In terms of the economic forecast, our economy continues to be stable and growing amidst a very turbulent environment.""

Technology and other high-growth stocks tend to get some of the biggest boosts from easier rates, and a 2.3% rise for Amazon and 2.1% lift for Nvidia were two of the strongest forces pushing the S&P 500 upward. Stocks of smaller companies, which often borrow to stay in business, also got a huge boost, with the Russell 2000 index of small stocks surging 5.4% for its best day in a year.

Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, Raut said the Israel embassy has sent a letter following his old post as someone might have told them to oppose him.  The post has since been deleted from his handle on X, formerly known as Twitter.  Referring to the post, the  Rajya Sabha member  on Saturday said, ""My tweet about Israel was an old one. It had a reference to Hitler, but I had no intention of hurting the sentiments of Israel. I have even deleted that tweet.""  ""I had even criticised the kind of attack Hamas initiated against Israel,"" he said.  Further referring to the attack initiated on Gaza-based hospitals where some children lost their lives, Raut said children should be kept out of war.  ""I had said this is inhuman. You are not showing humanity, so may be in the past a leader might have opposed you, that is what I said. After a month, the Israeli high commission has written a letter.

Ahead of the November 25 assembly polls in Rajasthan, the prime minister addressed rallies in Pali district and in Pilibanga in Hanumangarh district on Monday. At the election rally in Pali district, he asserted that Rajasthan needs a government which gives top priority to development, whereas for the Congress there is nothing more important than corruption and dynastic politics. He also accused the Congress and its allies of having an anti-women mindset. ""Ever since the law giving reservation to women (in Lok Sabha and state assemblies) was passed, they have started a campaign against women. The leaders of 'ghamandiya' alliance have made very objectionable comments about our mothers and sisters,"" he charged. #Elections With  Assembly Election News All Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan Telangana Chhattisgarh Mizoram From ports to airports, PM Modi 'controls' everything: Congress chief Kharge in Rajasthan Rajasthan polls: PM Modi conducts roadshow in Bikaner If donation boxes removed from temples, priests will abandon these places: Congress leader Wadettiwar Sardar Patel liberated Telangana from Razakars, Nizams: Amit Shah Prime Minister  Modi  has often targeted the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) as ""ghamandiya"" (arrogant) alliance. The prime minister said the Bihar chief minister used derogatory words against women in the assembly but no Congress leader said anything about this. ""This is the real face of Congress, which the people of Rajasthan have recognised,"" he said. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, while emphasising the importance of education among women to control the population, had recently put forward a vivid description in the state assembly of how an educated woman can restrain her husband during intercourse. He had later apologised for his remarks. Modi said the Bihar chief minister also used derogatory language against a former chief minister because he was from a very backward family. ""...because he (the former CM) comes from a very backward family, hence he (Kumar) took pleasure in insulting him. Congress does not have the wisdom to tell (him) that it was wrong,"" he said. The prime minister also accused the Congress of turning a blind eye to incidents of atrocities against Dalits. ""Congress closes its eyes when it sees those committing atrocities against Dalits,"" he said. ""The Congress government here thinks of nothing except appeasement,"" he said and added that because of this policy, those with the mentality of riots and terrorism flourished in the state in the past five years. He alleged that the Congress and its allies want to destroy sanatan dharma. ""Destroying Sanatan means destroying the culture of Rajasthan,"" he added. Tamil Nadu Minister for Youth Welfare Udhayanidhi Stalin had stirred a row in September by alleging that sanatan dharma is against social justice and it should hence be eradicated. He had also likened sanatan dharma to the coronavirus and malaria. Holding the Congress responsible for high petrol prices in Rajasthan, Modi said when the BJP forms the government, it will review petrol prices in the state. In Rajasthan, he said, petrol was being sold at prices higher than in the BJP-ruled Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. The prime minister said that during the Congress regime, tax used to be collected on an income of Rs 2 lakh annually but now no tax is collected on income of up to Rs 7 lakh. ""Due to the reduction in direct tax, Rs 2.5 lakh crore has been saved,"" he said. Modi said if the price of mobile data was the same as during the time of the Congress government, one would have to spend Rs 5,000 more today on mobile data every month. Today, the entire country is working day and night for the goal of development and Rajasthan will play a huge role for India to attain a new height in the 21st century. ""There is a need for a government in Rajasthan which gives top priority to the development of the state,"" he said. Rajasthan goes to polls on November 25 and the results will be declared on December 3. In Pilibanga of Hanumangarh district, PM Modi said that corruption and nepotism were priority wherever the Congress is in power. Now it is also patronising drug smugglers in Rajasthan. ""Wherever Congress is in power, its priority is corruption and nepotism. Congress is never concerned about your needs. Now Congress is also promoting drug smugglers in Rajasthan,"" he said. He said that this addiction ""will destroy not only our children but also our future"" and it will ruin every family. ""I assure you that as soon as the BJP government is formed here, such action will be taken against drug smugglers that even other people will shudder after hearing and seeing them,"" he said. Talking about the ""Cancer Train"" -- called so as a large number of cancer patients travel in it - that runs to Bikaner from Hanumangarh and Sri Ganganagar, he noted that the train runs full and seats are not available in it. ""It is said that polluted drinking water is one of the reasons for the spread of cancer. I have also sent thousands of crores of rupees to Rajasthan under the Jal Jeevan Mission. But the Congress government here orchestrated a scam in this too and left you to drink poisonous water,"" he said. Before 2014, PM Modi said, the money of honest taxpayers was looted in scams and the poor middle class got nothing and Padma awards were given to those who had access to people in power. He said that on one side is the service spirit of the BJP government at the Centre and on the other side is the loot system of the Congress government in Rajasthan. ""Farmers, employees and businessmen of Rajasthan all paid taxes honestly. But in return they got dilapidated roads, streets, drains, lack of electricity and water, back-breaking inflation and unemployment,"" he said. The money which should have been used for the welfare of the poor, middle class and farmers was looted by MLAs and ministers, he asserted. In Video:

Matt Gaetz on Monday continued to tease introducing a motion to remove House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, accusing him of making a ""side deal"" with President Joe Biden on Ukraine funding to get Democratic support to avoid a government shutdown -- something McCarthy has denied. Speaking on the House floor, Gaetz said that ""there may be other votes coming today or later this week"" that could be affected by McCarthy's answers to his allegations about a secret deal. ""Members of the Republican Party might vote differently on a motion to vacate if they heard what the speaker had to share with us about the secret side deal with Joe Biden on Ukraine,"" Gaetz, R-Fla., said. ""I'll be listening. Stay tuned."" ""It is going to be difficult for my Republican friends to keep calling President Biden feeble while he continues to take Speaker McCarthy's lunch money in every negotiation,"" Gaetz added.  President Biden signed the spending bill just before the shutdown deadline but criticized Republicans for leaving out assistance to the war-torn nation. He said he expected McCarthy to ""keep his commitment"" to Ukrainians as spending negotiations continued. ""We cannot under any circumstances allow American support for Ukraine to be interrupted,"" Biden said. ""I fully expect the speaker will keep his commitment to the people of Ukraine and secure passage of the support needed to help Ukraine at this critical moment."" When Biden was asked if he could trust Speaker McCarthy on the next deal after he backed off June's debt limit agreement, Biden said: ""We just made one about Ukraine. So, we'll find out."" Pressed on Biden's comment on Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeatedly refused to clarify what Biden had been talking about. ""When it relates to what the president said, I'm certainly not going to go beyond what he said,"" Jean-Pierre told ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce. ""But what we know, what we know is that there's bipartisan support for this deal. Again, Speaker McCarthy was on the air multiple times yesterday saying that he wants to, he certainly wants to continue to support for Ukraine to get the weapons that they need. And so, we're gonna hold him to that. That is something that he has said. That is a commitment that he has made."" Gaetz, during his floor speech, observed that Ukraine ""has lost the support of a majority of the majority"" – with the Florida congressman asserting that McCarthy had previously agreed to abide by the so-called ""Hastert Rule"" not to call a vote on legislation that the majority of House Republicans opposes. ""You cannot use Democrats to roll a majority of the majority -- certainly on something as consequential as Ukraine,"" Gaetz said. ""So for all the crocodile tears about what may happen later this week about the motion to vacate, working with the Democrats is a yellow brick road that has been paved by Speaker McCarthy, whether it was the debt limit deal, the CR, or now the secret deal on Ukraine."" Earlier Monday, McCarthy denied that he cut a deal with President Biden to hold a vote on Ukraine funding but rather said he promised White House officials could meet with congressional staff to discuss the president's supplemental request. ""What I have always said before I am for weapons for Ukraine. That's how I have voted. I've been very clear in the process that he's got a problem that he has not shown a clear message on how we're going to win and what is our mission?"" McCarthy said. ""I've been very clear about American border takes priority."" McCarthy also indicated he is open to arming Ukrainians but not as keen about rebuilding the country. ""There are more Americans being killed because of the southern border than there are with Ukraine,"" he said. ""I believe Ukraine is very important. I have already always supported arming Ukraine. It's not sending money to Ukraine, that's arming Ukraine with the weaponry to the defend."" Questioned further about a possible motion to vacate, McCarthy attempted to steer the focus back to government funding. He told reporters that his ""entire focus"" is on finishing the House's appropriations bills after he teamed up with Democrats to avert a government shutdown on Saturday. ""We want to continue to finish all of our work. We've got a short time period here about 45 days to get our work done,"" McCarthy said as he he arrived at the Capitol on Monday morning.  The short-term funding bill passed over the weekend, which funds government until Nov. 17, didn't include financial aid to Ukraine. House Democratic leadership also released a statement stating they ""expect Speaker McCarthy to advance a bill to the House Floor for an up-or-down vote that supports Ukraine"" when the House returned to session. When asked if he'll need Democratic votes to help keep him in the position were a motion to vacate be filed, McCarthy said, ""You'd have to ask them I don't know. I'm just gonna focus on doing the work I'm supposed to do. I think this is a question to the institution itself. I know in the past the other leaders together always believed this should never be in play. But I'm not worried about it. I've got a job to do."" McCarthy was noncommittal on cutting a deal with Democrats to stay on as speaker. Ahead of Gaetz's floor speech, another Republican made the case for McCarthy staying on as speaker -- stating a motion to vacate would hurt conservative priorities. ""The immediate effect would paralyze the House indefinitely just when we are on the verge of completing the appropriations process that will initiate discussions with the Senate that are vital to change the dangerous path that our country is on,"" Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., said of a motion to vacate. ""I cannot imagine a more counterproductive and self-destructive course than that."" Moments after he spoke on the House floor, Gaetz conceded to ABC News that he may not have the votes to kick McCarthy out of his job as he addressed reporters outside the Capitol. Asked by ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott if he would he try again if his efforts fail, Gaetz said, ""Yeah."" ""Well, like I've said it took Speaker McCarthy 15 votes to become the speaker. So, until I get to 14 or 15, I don't think I'm being any more dilatory than he was,"" he said. ABC News' Rachel Scott, Lalee Ibssa and Ben Gittleson contributed to this report.","Hard-line Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz on Monday continued to tease introducing a motion to remove House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, accusing him of making a ""side deal"" with President Joe Biden on Ukraine funding to get Democratic support to avoid a government shutdown -- something McCarthy has denied. Speaking on the House floor, Gaetz said that ""there may be other votes coming today or later this week"" that could be affected by McCarthy's answers to his allegations about a secret deal. ""Members of the Republican Party might vote differently on a motion to vacate if they heard what the speaker had to share with us about the secret side deal with Joe Biden on Ukraine,"" Gaetz, R-Fla., said. ""I'll be listening. Stay tuned."" ""It is going to be difficult for my Republican friends to keep calling President Biden feeble while he continues to take Speaker McCarthy's lunch money in every negotiation,"" Gaetz added.  President Biden signed the spending bill just before the shutdown deadline but criticized Republicans for leaving out assistance to the war-torn nation. He said he expected McCarthy to ""keep his commitment"" to Ukrainians as spending negotiations continued. ""We cannot under any circumstances allow American support for Ukraine to be interrupted,"" Biden said. ""I fully expect the speaker will keep his commitment to the people of Ukraine and secure passage of the support needed to help Ukraine at this critical moment.""

People are living longer but some spend many of their later years in bad health - and that has to change, he said.  Based on projections, the elderly boom will be in rural, largely coastal, areas and these places are often poor cousins when it comes to provision.  In deprived regions, age-related issues emerge 10 years earlier, on average.  While young people flock to wealthy cities, areas such as Scarborough, North Norfolk or the south coast of England are going to age ""rapidly and predictably"", says the report - Sir Chris's fourth in the role.  He told me: ""We've really got to get serious about the areas of the country where ageing is happening very fast, and we've got to do it now.  ""It's possible to compress the period of time that people spend in ill health...because otherwise we will end up with large numbers of people leading much more dependent lives."" Providing services and environments suitable for older adults in these areas is an absolute priority, the report says. Much of the NHS's work is already caring for an ageing population, and that is set to increase. The fact that people are living longer compared to a century ago is ""a triumph of medicine and public health"". But the emphasis needs to be on quality, not quantity, says the report. It says major action in two areas could help turn things around: Sir Chris explained: ""Houses are built for young families...and if you project forward to the middle of the century, a quarter of the population will be over 65, yet we still have a housing stock not designed for that age group."" He said people should adopt ""old-fashioned"" methods to stay healthy. ""Having lots of exercise, having mental stimulation and a social network, eating a reasonably balanced diet... these are things which are old-fashioned, but they still work."" People should also make choices about what care they do and don't want, and doctors should refrain from over-treating.  Improving quality of life in older age sometimes means less medicine, not more, says the report. Sir Chris said: ""That might be, 'I want to go to hospital but I don't want to go to intensive care'. It might be, 'I want to have treatment but I don't want to have an operation'. Or it might be 'I don't want any more treatment at all'. The conversation needs to be had.""   Prof Dame Carol Black, from the Centre for Ageing Better, said: ""Many people are facing enormous challenges and hardship in their later years, as this report makes clear.    ""We don't all have an equal opportunity to age well. Wealth, work, housing, discrimination; all play a significant role in the huge gap in healthy life expectancy between the richest and poorest areas of the country."" Paul Farmer, chief executive at Age UK, called for a cross-government ageing strategy, and a minister for older people to help drive forward change.  ""We can already see how the failure to invest in delivering the right services and support is leading to worse outcomes for older people and entirely avoidable problems,"" he said.  ""Older people are isolated at home if the design of our communities means they can't safely go out. People end up falling, and in the back of an ambulance if our built environment is full of trip hazards. ""Our hospitals are over capacity at least in part, due to the failure to provide adequate social care and community services to enable people to stay safe and well at home. None of this is inevitable. Getting it right would have immeasurable benefits.""","The UK faces an ageing crisis and healthcare must step in, England's chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, warns in his annual report.

Early this year, EU leaders promised to provide 1 million rounds of ammunition to Ukraine's front line by spring next year in what would have amounted to a serious ramp-up of production. But the 27-nation bloc, for over half a century steeped in a ""peace, not war"" message and sheltering under a US military umbrella, is finding it tough to come up with the goods.   ""The 1 million will not be reached, you have to assume that,"" said German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius, ahead of a meeting of EU defence and foreign affairs ministers in Brussels.   Estonia's defence minister, Hanno Pevkur, said it was crucial to ramp up supply of the ammunition.   ""Look at Russia. They are producing today more than ever. They are getting shells from North Korea. Europe cannot say that ... Russia and North Korea can deliver and we cannot,'"" he said.   Some 300,000 rounds have been delivered from existing stocks in the EU so far. With the rest becoming increasingly elusive to source before spring, Latvian Defence Minister Andris Spruds insisted the original target should not be taken too literally.   ""Well, of course, 1 million rounds are symbolic. I think aspiration and ambition is important,"" he said.   On the battlefield, though, the presence of ammunition is the only thing that counts.   In Ukraine's war with Russia, 155mm artillery rounds play a pivotal role. The daily consumption of 6,000 to 7,000 shells highlights its strategic importance. Acquiring 1 million such shells could secure stability for Ukraine for at least half a year, providing a substantial advantage in sustained operations and flexibility on the battlefield, observers said.   EU Commissioner Thierry Breton insisted the  industry  production target of 1 million rounds could be met by industry. ""But it is now upon member states to place their orders.""   However, member states put the blame on producers.   ""We have all signed contracts. We've done joint procurement. So industry now has to deliver. It has to step up its game to produce more,"" said Dutch defence Minister Kajsa Ollongren.   Breton acknowledged that the EU's over-reliance on so-called soft power and decades of sinking budgets in many European nations had left the bloc exposed.   ""As you well know, it is history, certainly the peace dividend. It is true that we dropped a bit, even significantly, our production capacity, but the industrial base is still there"" to ramp up production anew, he said.   One way to get more ammunition, said EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell, was to redirect current EU exports and prioritise Ukraine.   ""About 40% of the production is being exported to third countries,"" he said. ""So maybe what we have to do is to try to shift this production to the priority one, which is the Ukrainians.""

With almost all votes counted, Mr Milei had won close to 56% in the decisive run-off, ahead of his left-wing rival, Sergio Massa, with 44%. The radical newcomer's victory has been described as ""a political earthquake"". It has been welcomed by like-minded politicians such as US ex-President Donald Trump, who said Mr Milei would ""Make Argentina Great Again"". Brazil's former leader Jair Bolsonaro said that ""hope would shine again in South America"".  Sometimes dubbed ""El Loco"" (the madman) by his critics, Mr Milei has promised drastic changes, which include ditching the local currency, the peso, for the US dollar and ""blowing up"" the central bank in order to prevent it from printing more money, which he argues is driving inflation.  He has also proposed cutting welfare payments and slashing bureaucracy by closing the ministries of culture, women, health and education, among others.  In a round of media interviews following his election win, he said he would privatise Argentina's state energy company, YPF, and the country's public broadcasters. ""Everything than can be [put] into the hands of the private sector, will be in the hands of the private sector,"" he said. However, Mr Milei added that before YPF could be privatised, it would have to be ""rebuilt"". He did not say how long that process could take.  The president-elect also announced that public works would be ""cut down to zero"" and those already in progress would be put out to tender so that ""there would be no more state spending"". On social issues, he wants to loosen gun laws, abolish abortion - which was legalised in Argentina in 2020 - and allow the sale and purchase of human organs.  Mr Milei's victory comes amid a deep economic crisis which has seen annual inflation rise to 143% and 40% of Argentines living in poverty. While opinion polls conducted before the election had given Mr Milei a slight lead over Mr Massa, the wide margin of his win - by more than 11% according to provisional results - has surprised many.  Mr Massa, who is the economy minister in the outgoing left-wing government, quickly conceded defeat saying that ""obviously the results are not what we had hoped for"". Analysts say Mr Milei's aggressive style and his promise to ""do away with the political caste"", which he blames for the country's ills, appealed to voters who were fed up with Argentina's established parties. ""This model of decadence has come to an end. There is no turning back,"" he told his supporters in his victory speech, promising a new era for Argentina. ""From being the richest country in the world, today we are (ranked) 130. Half of Argentines are poor and the other 10% are destitute. Stop this impoverishing model of the caste. Today we embrace the Libertarian model so as to return to being a global power,"" he said. He also announced that the changes he would bring in would be drastic and immediate.  During campaigning, the former economist and pundit held a chainsaw aloft to symbolise plans to cut spending. His message appeared to resonate with voters celebrating his win in the streets of Buenos Aires. One woman told AFP news agency that ""we were very tired, we wanted to renew, we wanted to see new faces, always the same ones, I bet on change, on Milei, that it will go well for him, it will go well for the country"". However, economists have been more circumspect, pointing out that Mr Milei's party only holds a small number of seats in Argentina's Congress and that he will therefore have to negotiate with the very politicians he disparaged and attacked during the campaign. Despite his anti-establishment rhetoric, Mr Milei has in the past been quick to bury the hatchet if it suits him politically.  Following his win in the first round, he stopped attacking the third-placed candidate, conservative Patricia Bullrich, who in turn threw her weight behind Mr Milei in the second round.  In his victory speech, he thanked both Ms Bullrich and the conservative former president, Mauricio Macri, who had also endorsed him.  But while his supporters took to the streets of the capital, Buenos Aires, chanting ""change!"", there are also those who worry about what Mr Milei's victory may mean for Argentine society. His choice of Victoria Villarruel as his vice-presidential running mate shocked human rights campaigners in the country, in which 30,000 people were killed or forcibly disappeared under military rule from 1976 to 1983. Ms Villarruel, who comes from a military family, has defended officers convicted of crimes against humanity and proposed dismantling a museum which commemorates victims of Argentina's military junta.

An ethnic armed group has carried out attacks on border guard outposts in Myanmar’s western Rakhine state, and fighting has erupted in neighbouring Chin state, sending thousands of people across the border into India. Myanmar’s generals are facing their biggest test since seizing power in a 2021 coup after The Three Brotherhood Alliance, an alliance of ethnic minority armed groups, launcheda major offensivein late October overrunning more than 80 military outposts and taking large caches of military weapons and ammunition. One of the allied groups, the Arakan Army, which is fighting for greater autonomy in Rakhine State, seized posts in the Rathedaung and Minbya areas, about 200km (124 miles) apart, AA spokesman Khine Thu Kha said on Monday. “We have conquered some posts, and fighting is continuing in some other places,” he told local media. Gunfire broke out before dawn, followed by hours of artillery bombardment, residents said, with the military seen blocking entrances to the area and reinforcing administrative buildings. Richard Horsey, senior Myanmar adviser for the Crisis Group think tank, said the attacks increased the risk of renewed conflict in the long troubled state, where abrutal military crackdown on the Rohingya in 2017is now the subject of a genocide case at the International Court of Justice. “If combat persists, it will open a significant new front for the regime, which is already overstretched,” Horsey said. “It will be hard for the regime to focus their efforts across all fronts.” Renewed fighting also broke out inChin State, which lies north of Rakhine and borders India, when fighters attacked two military camps, according to an Indian official and two sources with knowledge of the assault. About 5,000 people from Myanmar crossed intoIndia’s Mizoram stateas a result of the fighting, said James Lalrinchhana, the deputy commissioner of a district on the Myanmar border. There was no immediate comment from Myanmar’s military on the latest fighting. The Three Brotherhood Alliance, which also includes the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, is part of a coalition of seven armed ethnic organisations that maintain close ties with China and have bases or territories near the country’s borders. The success of their offensive has given renewed momentum to the anti-coup movement with fighters elsewhere, including the central state ofSagaing, reporting new advances. The generals have acknowledged the challenge the offensive poses to the regime. Myint Swe, the military-appointed president, told a national defence and security council meeting this month, “It is necessary to carefully control this issue.” Senior General Min Aung Hlaing led a coup on February 1, 2021 to remove the government of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The power grab triggered mass rallies demanding the restoration of civilian rule, but when the military responded with brutal force manyprotesters took up arms, joining forces with ethnic armed groups on the country’s borders. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a Myanmar advocacy group that has been tracking the crisis, says at least 4,182 civilians and pro-democracy activists have been killed by the military in the escalating violence, and nearly 20,000 people have been jailed by the regime. The United Nations says 1.7 million people have been forced from their homes as a result of the crisis.          Follow Al Jazeera English:","Arakan Army says it seized military posts in western Rakhine state as people in neighbouring Chin state flee to India. An ethnic armed group has carried out attacks on border guard outposts in Myanmar’s western Rakhine state, and fighting has erupted in neighbouring Chin state, sending thousands of people across the border into India. Myanmar’s generals are facing their biggest test since seizing power in a 2021 coup after The Three Brotherhood Alliance, an alliance of ethnic minority armed groups, launcheda major offensivein late October overrunning more than 80 military outposts and taking large caches of military weapons and ammunition.

But life had other plans.Knight, a former athlete from Portland, Oregon, refused to let failure stop him. Despite setbacks, he kept pushing forward with determination and an unwavering spirit. He was an average runner at best in school, but one thing ignited his spark - shoes.He fell in love withsneakers so much that he thought one day he would make his own.His path to this goal had a few bumps along the way. Despite his love for the sport and the shoes, he was not an excellent athlete. While competing in a track meet at the University of Oregon, he lost so badly that he started contemplating quitting the sport altogether. But, the thrill of running made him think otherwise.In 1962, Knight was awarded a scholarship to pursue an MBA at Stanford Graduate School of Business, which proved to be a life-changing opportunity. It was here that fate would decide his destiny. In a class titled Entrepreneurship, taught by former University of Oregon track coach Bill Bowerman, Knight had a moment of inspiration. Bowerman was known for his unorthodox and often experimental shoemaking techniques, and he instilled in his students a passion for innovation. It was during this time that Knight became fascinated by the way shoes could affect an athlete's performance. He noticed that many of the shoes available at the time were heavy and cumbersome, and he believed that he could design a better shoe that would help athletes run faster and jump higher.Bill Bowerman was Phil Knight's track coach, teacher, and co-founder of Nike. Source: University of OregonHe put his knowledge and interest into action and started the company, Blue Ribbon Sports, selling Japanese running shoes called Tiger shoes. But selling wasn’t his strong suit. While managing his business, he also opted to pursue a formal education. He completed his MBA during the day and sold shoes evenings and weekends out of the trunk of his car. He spent the next few years learning as much as he could about the shoe industry, and in 1971, he and Bowerman decided to start their own shoe company. Nike was founded with a meager $1,500, with the promise to create better running shoes.When it came to making the logo, they looked for someone who could do it for ‘Free’. Carolyn Davidson was an excellent graphic design student working at Portland State University while her husband Jeff Johnson who was Knight’s accountant introduced her to his employer after seeing her sketch ‘Swoosh’. With some changes done by Knight for a minor amount as a token of appreciation in 1971, the legendary logo has become one of the most recognizable brand identifiers worldwide to this day.Their goal was to create a shoe that was lighter, more comfortable, and more performance-oriented than anything else on the market. However, this process was slow and far from perfect. The first few years of Nike's existence were a struggle. The incredible performances of Nike's athletes during the 1972 Olympics led to a remarkable increase in sales, reaching an impressive $3 million. Knight even started paying himself his first salary from the money that came in. This gave him a new sense of hope and he felt the business was now gaining the momentum it needed but at the same time, they kept facing problems of supply and quality. Even though everything was improving slowly and steadily he was facing an internal power struggle with Bowerman. Eventually, though, Nike's relentless efforts to innovate and create high-quality shoes paid off as the brand gained immense popularity among athletes who valued their superior design and top-notch performance.Within 20 years, Nike had become the number-one-selling athletic footwear company in the world. It is estimated that one in every 3 adults on the planet owns a pair of Nike shoes. From his failed athletics career to being the co-founder of one of the most successful sports brands in history, Knight's story is a testimony to the power of perseverance and the belief in one's own vision.Today, Nike is the world’s leading sports brand, with annual revenues of over $46 billion and a market value of over $166 billion. It has expanded its product range to include apparel, accessories, equipment, and digital services for various sports and activities. It also sponsors many high-profile athletes and teams across the globe, such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Serena Williams, LeBron James, and the US Olympic team.

In an interview with ETMarkets, Gohil said, “The defence sector could continue to be in the spotlight, considering a projected 2-3% spending as a percentage of GDP over the next decade” Edited excerpts: The festive season has begun, and we are seeing signs of stabilization as volatility has reduced. How are you looking at markets? Global equity markets are likely to react positively to signs of easing labor market conditions in the US. Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO Courses Offering College Course Website Indian School of Business ISB Chief Digital Officer Visit IIM Kozhikode IIMK Chief Product Officer Programme Visit IIM Lucknow IIML Chief Operations Officer Programme Visit With major central banks pausing their rate hike cycles, EM equity outflows could moderate, making 2023 a rewarding year for Indian equity investors. The FPI holding of Indian equities has fallen to a multi-year low, while India’s weight in the MSCI Emerging Market Index has doubled to a mid-teen level. The domestic investment in equities has a huge headroom to rise further and hence, India’s valuation may remain higher for longer as every dip is going to be supported by buying of Indian equities, in our view. We believe the largecaps are trading at a decent valuation after the mark underperformance versus mid and smallcaps. Investors should be careful as some of the investment-led sectors in mid and small-caps are at euphoric valuations and within the large-cap as well we are experiencing major disruptions. For instance, sector leaders in innerwear, paint, room air conditioning, footwear, and QSR are facing intensifying competition. This structural shift may lead to margin compression and valuation adjustments for these companies. Even the top-performing private banks are experiencing valuation contractions as investment opportunities broaden. However, this environment will favour a bottom-up stock-picking approach, with distinct companies emerging as winners. How are you reading the overall economic growth momentum in India? The government implementing corporate tax cuts, massive infrastructure spending, import restrictions and export promotion policies. However, this approach has been accompanied by high retail fuel taxes, lower-than-anticipated MSP increases for farmers, and a hiring freeze or slow hiring in most PSUs etc. Even private sector job growth is slowing down and household financial saving as a percentage of GDP has fallen to a fifty-year low. Food subsidy bills will rise further and MANREGA spending may overshoot the budgeted target in this fiscal materially. The government's strategy revolves around improved infrastructure and enhanced corporate profitability to boost private sector job creation and self-employment. This strategy assumes that rising nominal GDP growth will benefit everyone. However, corporations prioritise profit maximisation, and infrastructure development takes time to generate self-employment opportunities. In the near term, asset owners are reaping significant benefits, leading to a surge in premium consumption, while savings and consumption are suffering. With over 8 million new entrants joining the workforce annually, failure to address job creation could lead to a resurgence of ‘bad economics but good politics’. While GDP numbers may remain robust, driven by investments, addressing job growth and low-end consumption is crucial ahead of next year's general elections. The US Federal Reserve outlook helped to calm the nerves of some investors. At the same time, we are seeing a rise in the US Yields and FII exodus. How will the scenario play out for the rest of FY24? It is not just about the Fed pausing the rate hikes, but also about rising debt. The US economy is currently thriving on fiscal expansion, which is essentially through subsidies, cash transfers, bailouts, loan waivers, lower taxes etc. This has led to a rising debt-to-GDP ratio to uncomfortable levels for a reserve currency coupled with an over 8% fiscal deficit. As a result, the US government's borrowing costs are likely to remain high unless spending cuts or tax hikes are implemented, which seems unlikely ahead of next year's elections. Additionally, central banks in countries such as China, India, and Brazil have begun to reduce their holdings of US Treasuries. Mark-to-market losses on bond portfolios and tight liquidity conditions will eventually have a material impact on bank and corporate profitability in the developed markets but with a lag. Cracks are already visible in the form of higher credit card delinquencies and a decline in mortgage application rates. As savings deplete, we expect the US economy to cool off. As economic activity in developed markets deteriorates it could benefit FPI flows into India. One recent example is the regional banking crisis that led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2023. This event prompted a brief expansion of the Fed's balance sheet and a surge of FPI inflows into India in the following months. How do you sum up markets from last Samvat? Any key learnings that investors should take note off? India has developed and demonstrated remarkable financial stability. Investors are taking note of India’s ability to maneuver its mammoth and diverse economy during extremely difficult times, such as importing cheap oil from Russia skirting the US sanctions, the successful hosting of G-20 amid the Russia-Ukraine war, controlling NPAs during the collapse in economic activities during the COVID outbreak, etc. Secondly, India is now poised to become a roughly Rs 300 trillion economy by March 2024, and its size could exceed Rs 400 trillion in the next three years. As the depth and breadth of the financial market expand, India is expected to capture a significant share of global allocations. Lastly, with higher tax collections and incessant spending on Infrastructure, substantial growth pick-up should be visible with a lag. The market has been underestimating India’s growth in the previous four years and it is likely that in FY 2024, the growth numbers could surprise on the upside. What are your expectations from markets in Samvat 2080? Any key targets for both Nifty and Sensex that you have marked? Markets are forward-looking and may start to price in rate cuts by major central banks, hopefully, within the next 12 to 18 months. Also, two important events await India next year: the general elections and India's bond inclusion in global indices. Return expectations will vary depending on the continuation of the current government. Nevertheless, in the medium to long term, investors should moderate their expectations to around 12-13% returns for Nifty and Sensex, given already high valuations. Nifty and Sensex may not be the true barometers due to the significant disruptions we are witnessing. It will be a stock picker's market, as we are already seeing past winners underperforming materially due to heightened competition, already stretched valuations, and the emergence of newer companies. Which sectors are likely to hog the limelight in Samvat 2080? We are positive on interest rate-sensitive sectors from a 12-month perspective as interest rates seem to be peaking. NBFCs, banks, and real estate are likely to perform well in a falling interest-rate environment. Secondly, the defence sector could continue to be in the spotlight, considering a projected 2-3% spending as a percentage of GDP over the next decade. One should closely monitor China's policies; if the economy rebounds, chemicals and commodity-related sectors could benefit materially in Samvat 2080. What are your expectations from Gold in Samvat 2080? US Treasuries are more attractive compared to gold given the higher real interest rate environment. Nevertheless, ongoing geopolitics, de-dollarisation talks, and peaking interest rates may support gold prices. One can consider a 5% holding in gold as a diversification tool. If someone has Rs 10L to invest on Diwali – how should he/she do a selection of sectors in Samvat 2080? Please mention the percentage for each sector totalling 100%. Interest rate-sensitive sectors should be preferred, I would invest about 45-50% in Banks, NBFCs, and Real Estate stocks. Malls, hotels, travel sectors, auto and select consumers can account for another 25% of the portfolio. Energy, Power, Cement and infrastructure, defence about 15%, and remaining in IT and Pharma. Sector rotation can be tricky, chemicals and large-cap IT sectors are experiencing a rough patch, and investors with slightly longer-term horizons can start accumulating these stocks. Recently, we saw some pressure on the currency. How is currency likely to move in Samvat 2080? There is a possibility of the dollar strengthening? The RBI is going to defend any disorderly deprecation in the INR as India is aiming to improve the rupee’s status globally for trade. Gradual and controlled depreciation of the Indian rupee is desirable when the country is trying to promote import substitution and export promotion. There are multiple events including general elections, India’s bond addition in global indices, and let’s not forget how China decides to stimulate or support their economy. If the Chinese yuan (CNY) depreciates sharply, the RBI may also let the Indian rupee fall given significant imports from China can hurt the Indian economy and jobs. Our Chief Economist believes the Indian rupee to remain under 83.5 levels.

However, corporations prioritise profit maximisation, and infrastructure development takes time to generate self-employment opportunities. In the near term, asset owners are reaping significant benefits, leading to a surge in premium consumption, while savings and consumption are suffering. With over 8 million new entrants joining the workforce annually, failure to address job creation could lead to a resurgence of ‘bad economics but good politics’. While GDP numbers may remain robust, driven by investments, addressing job growth and low-end consumption is crucial ahead of next year's general elections. The US Federal Reserve outlook helped to calm the nerves of some investors. At the same time, we are seeing a rise in the US Yields and FII exodus. How will the scenario play out for the rest of FY24? It is not just about the Fed pausing the rate hikes, but also about rising debt. The US economy is currently thriving on fiscal expansion, which is essentially through subsidies, cash transfers, bailouts, loan waivers, lower taxes etc. This has led to a rising debt-to-GDP ratio to uncomfortable levels for a reserve currency coupled with an over 8% fiscal deficit. As a result, the US government's borrowing costs are likely to remain high unless spending cuts or tax hikes are implemented, which seems unlikely ahead of next year's elections. Additionally, central banks in countries such as China, India, and Brazil have begun to reduce their holdings of US Treasuries. Mark-to-market losses on bond portfolios and tight liquidity conditions will eventually have a material impact on bank and corporate profitability in the developed markets but with a lag. Cracks are already visible in the form of higher credit card delinquencies and a decline in mortgage application rates. As savings deplete, we expect the US economy to cool off. As economic activity in developed markets deteriorates it could benefit FPI flows into India. One recent example is the regional banking crisis that led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2023. This event prompted a brief expansion of the Fed's balance sheet and a surge of FPI inflows into India in the following months. How do you sum up markets from last Samvat? Any key learnings that investors should take note off? India has developed and demonstrated remarkable financial stability. Investors are taking note of India’s ability to maneuver its mammoth and diverse economy during extremely difficult times, such as importing cheap oil from Russia skirting the US sanctions, the successful hosting of G-20 amid the Russia-Ukraine war, controlling NPAs during the collapse in economic activities during the COVID outbreak, etc. Secondly, India is now poised to become a roughly Rs 300 trillion economy by March 2024, and its size could exceed Rs 400 trillion in the next three years. As the depth and breadth of the financial market expand, India is expected to capture a significant share of global allocations. Lastly, with higher tax collections and incessant spending on Infrastructure, substantial growth pick-up should be visible with a lag. The market has been underestimating India’s growth in the previous four years and it is likely that in FY 2024, the growth numbers could surprise on the upside. What are your expectations from markets in Samvat 2080? Any key targets for both Nifty and Sensex that you have marked? Markets are forward-looking and may start to price in rate cuts by major central banks, hopefully, within the next 12 to 18 months. Also, two important events await India next year: the general elections and India's bond inclusion in global indices. Return expectations will vary depending on the continuation of the current government. Nevertheless, in the medium to long term, investors should moderate their expectations to around 12-13% returns for Nifty and Sensex, given already high valuations. Nifty and Sensex may not be the true barometers due to the significant disruptions we are witnessing. It will be a stock picker's market, as we are already seeing past winners underperforming materially due to heightened competition, already stretched valuations, and the emergence of newer companies. Which sectors are likely to hog the limelight in Samvat 2080? We are positive on interest rate-sensitive sectors from a 12-month perspective as interest rates seem to be peaking. NBFCs, banks, and real estate are likely to perform well in a falling interest-rate environment. Secondly, the defence sector could continue to be in the spotlight, considering a projected 2-3% spending as a percentage of GDP over the next decade. One should closely monitor China's policies; if the economy rebounds, chemicals and commodity-related sectors could benefit materially in Samvat 2080. What are your expectations from Gold in Samvat 2080? US Treasuries are more attractive compared to gold given the higher real interest rate environment. Nevertheless, ongoing geopolitics, de-dollarisation talks, and peaking interest rates may support gold prices. One can consider a 5% holding in gold as a diversification tool. If someone has Rs 10L to invest on Diwali – how should he/she do a selection of sectors in Samvat 2080? Please mention the percentage for each sector totalling 100%. Interest rate-sensitive sectors should be preferred, I would invest about 45-50% in Banks, NBFCs, and Real Estate stocks. Malls, hotels, travel sectors, auto and select consumers can account for another 25% of the portfolio. Energy, Power, Cement and infrastructure, defence about 15%, and remaining in IT and Pharma. Sector rotation can be tricky, chemicals and large-cap IT sectors are experiencing a rough patch, and investors with slightly longer-term horizons can start accumulating these stocks. Recently, we saw some pressure on the currency. How is currency likely to move in Samvat 2080? There is a possibility of the dollar strengthening? The RBI is going to defend any disorderly deprecation in the INR as India is aiming to improve the rupee’s status globally for trade. Gradual and controlled depreciation of the Indian rupee is desirable when the country is trying to promote import substitution and export promotion. There are multiple events including general elections, India’s bond addition in global indices, and let’s not forget how China decides to stimulate or support their economy. If the Chinese yuan (CNY) depreciates sharply, the RBI may also let the Indian rupee fall given significant imports from China can hurt the Indian economy and jobs. Our Chief Economist believes the Indian rupee to remain under 83.5 levels.

The San Francisco-based company said late Tuesday that it “reached an agreement in principle” for co-founder Sam Altman to return as CEO under a different board of directors. The agreement followed intense negotiations that began Saturday between Altman’s side and the board members who pushed him out. The discussions included disagreements about Altman’s future role and who would stay on the board, according to a person familiar with the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to speak publicly about such sensitive matters. An independent investigation into Altman and the events that led to his ouster, announced earlier this week, will continue, according to the person, who described board members’ slow erosion of trust in the OpenAI leader without pointing to any serious wrongdoing. The company previously made unspecified allegations that Altman had not been candid with the board. The lack of transparency surrounding Altman’s firing led to a weekend of internal conflict at the company and growing outside pressure from the startup’s investors, particularly Microsoft, which on Monday hired Altman and a key ally, OpenAI co-founder and president Greg Brockman, and opened its doors to any of the other more than 700 employees who wanted to join them. The turmoil accentuated the differences between Altman — who has become the face of generative AI’s rapid commercialization since ChatGPT’s arrival a year ago — and board members who have expressed deep reservations about the safety risks posed by AI as it gets more advanced. One of the four board members who participated in Altman’s ouster, OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, was involved in the negotiations over the weekend. But that changed when he publicly expressed regret about the decision Monday morning and joined the call for the board’s resignation. The person familiar with the talks said board members did not want the company to tank or employees to defect to Microsoft. At the same time, they did not want to acquiesce to demands that they all step down, nor did they want to reinstate Altman and Brockman on the board or install new members who might not stand up to them, the person said. In the end, most of them did step down. The new board will be led by former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, who chaired Twitter's board before Elon Musk took over the platform last year. The other members will be former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo, the only member of the previous board to stay on. “The OpenAI episode shows how fragile the AI ecosystem is right now, including addressing AI’s risks,” said Johann Laux, an expert at the Oxford Internet Institute focusing on human oversight of artificial intelligence. Before the board was replaced, venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, a vocal Altman supporter whose firm is an OpenAI investor, wrote in an opinion column at The Information that board members had set back the “tremendous benefits” of AI by misapplying their “religion of ‘effective altruism.’” Some of OpenAI's board members over the years have had ties to effective altruism, the philanthropic social movement that prioritizes donating to projects that will have the greatest impact on the largest number of people, including humans in the future. While many effective altruists believe AI could offer powerful benefits, they also advocate for mitigating the technology’s potential risks. Helping to drive Altman's return and the installation of a new board was Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and has rights to its existing technology. While promising to welcome OpenAI's fleeing workforce, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also made clear in a series of interviews Monday that he was open to the possibility of Altman returning to OpenAI as long as the startup's governance problems were solved. “We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Nadella posted on X late Tuesday. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed and effective governance.” In his own post, Altman said that with the new board and with Satya's support, he was ""looking forward to returning to OpenAI and building on our strong partnership"" with Microsoft. Gone from the OpenAI board are its only two women: tech entrepreneur Tasha McCauley and Helen Toner, a policy expert at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, both of whom have expressed concerns about AI safety risks. The leadership drama offers a glimpse into how big tech companies are taking the lead in governing AI and its risks, while governments scramble to catch up. The European Union is working to finalize the world’s first comprehensive AI rules. In the absence of regulations, “companies decide how a technology is rolled out,"" said Oxford's Laux. Co-founded by Altman as a nonprofit with a mission to safely build AI that outperforms humans and benefits humanity, OpenAI later became a for-profit business — but one still run by its nonprofit board of directors. This was not OpenAI’s first experience with executive turmoil. Past examples including a 2018 falling out between board co-chairs Altman and Musk that led to Musk’s exit, and a later exodus of top leaders who started the competitor Anthropic. It's not clear yet if the board's structure will change with its new members. Under the current structure, all profit beyond a certain cap is supposed to go back to its mission of helping humanity. The board is also tasked with deciding when AI systems have become so advanced that they are better than humans “at most economically valuable work.” At that point, Microsoft's intellectual property licenses no longer apply. “We are collaborating to figure out the details,” OpenAI posted on social media. “Thank you so much for your patience through this.” Nadella said Brockman, who was OpenAI's board chairman until Altman's firing, also will have a key role to play in ensuring the group “continues to thrive and build on its mission.” As for OpenAI's short-lived interim CEO Emmett Shear, the second temporary leader in the days since Altman's ouster, he posted on X that he was “deeply pleased by this result"" after about 72 ""very intense hours of work.” “Coming into OpenAI, I wasn't sure what the right path would be,” wrote Shear, the former head of Twitch. “This was the pathway that maximized safety alongside doing right by all stakeholders involved. I'm glad to have been a part of the solution.” The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement allowing OpenAI access to part of the AP’s text archives. ___ Associated Press writers Kelvin Chan in London and Thalia Beaty in New York contributed to this report.","The ousted leader of ChatGPT maker OpenAI will return to the company that fired him just days ago, concluding a short but chaotic power struggle that shocked the tech industry and underscored the conflicts around how to safely buildartificial intelligence.

Prosecutors say Joseph Czuba stabbed Wadea al-Fayoume to death and seriously wounded his mother in the attack. Mr Czuba, 71, allegedly targeted the two, who were his tenants, because of their religion and the Israel-Hamas war. He is also facing attempted murder and aggravated battery charges.  In a court hearing on Monday, Mr Czuba spoke briefly to acknowledge the court.  If convicted of murder, he faces up to 20 years to life in prison. Mr Czuba's court-appointed lawyers argued that he should be released pending trial, saying he has no previous convictions and is not a threat to the community. But Judge David Carlson disagreed and ordered him held in jail until the next hearing in the case in January.  According to court documents citing an interview with his wife, Mr Czuba regularly listened to conservative talk radio and was worried about reports of a ""National Day of Jihad"" on 13 October.  Mr Czuba's wife said he was also concerned that the country's power grid was going to go down, and had withdrawn $1,000 (£800) from a bank account. According to court documents, on 14 October Mr Czuba confronted Ms Shahin and told her he was angry about events in the Middle East. The court filing says that Ms Shahin responded: ""Let's pray for peace"". It is alleged that Mr Czuba then attacked her and her son with a military-style knife. She and Wadea had lived at the house for two years. Family members said there had been no previous hint of any conflict between Mr Czuba and the victims. An uncle and family spokesman, Yousef Hannon, said that Mr Czuba had bought Wadea a gift for his sixth birthday just a few weeks beforehand. The mother, 32-year-old Hanan Shahin, is still recovering and is expected to survive.  Wadea's father attended the hearing on Monday but declined to comment to reporters outside the courtroom. President Joe Biden deplored the alleged hate crime during a speech on the Middle East conflict earlier this month.
