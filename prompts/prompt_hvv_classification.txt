For the following list of characters/entities: ${char_list}, identify whether each one is a hero, villain, or victim based on how they are depicted in the story. Here are some definitions:
Hero: a fixer to a problem. They may increase agreement among members, boost commitment for a cause, or serve as a rallying point for a cause. 
Villain: a causer of a problem. They may focus blame, provide a clear target for action, intensify negative emotions, or solidify group identities.
Victim: one harmed by a problem. They are innocent, good, and in need of protection.

Note that a character's portrayal may be implicit through the portrayals of other characters associated with them. 
If none of these apply, respond "neither". Please respond only with one of these four options and respond ONLY with a valid JSON in the following format:

	"<CHARACTER_1>": <HERO_VILLAIN_VICTIM_NEITHER>,
