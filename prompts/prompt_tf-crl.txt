For the following list of characters/entities: ${char_list}, give a character role label that encapsulates how each is portrayed. A character's portrayal may be implicit through the portrayals of other characters associated with them. 
The character label must be a noun or short noun phrase, and must not be a job, professional occupation, or general description. Give one label per character. In addition, provide a modifier for the label to include more contextual information. The label should be generalizable and should capture a salient aspect of the character's portrayal, even without the modifier. The additional modifier should only help make the label more informative. Respond ONLY with a valid JSON in the following format: 
{
	"<CHARACTER_1>": ["< LABEL >", "< MODIFIER >"],
	"<CHARACTER_2>": ["< LABEL >", "< MODIFIER >"],
	...
}

Below are some examples for the list formatting:
Example 1) ["Hero", "Fallen"]
Example 2) ["Threat", "Economic"]
Example 3) ["Vulnerable Group", "Elderly"]
